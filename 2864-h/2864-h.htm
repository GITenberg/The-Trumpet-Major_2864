<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The present tale is founded more largely on
testimony&mdash;oral and written&mdash;than any other in this
series.&nbsp; The external incidents which direct its course are
mostly an unexaggerated reproduction of the recollections of old
persons well known to the author in childhood, but now long dead,
who were eye-witnesses of those scenes.&nbsp; If wholly
transcribed their recollections would have filled a volume thrice
the length of &lsquo;The Trumpet-Major.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Down to the middle of this century, and later, there were not
wanting, in the neighbourhood of the places more or less clearly
indicated herein, casual relics of the circumstances amid which
the action moves&mdash;our preparations for defence against the
threatened invasion of England by Buonaparte.&nbsp; An outhouse
door riddled with bullet-holes, which had been extemporized by a
solitary man as a target for firelock practice when the landing
was hourly expected, a heap of bricks and clods on a beacon-hill,
which had formed the chimney and walls of the hut occupied by the
beacon-keeper, worm-eaten shafts and iron heads of pikes for the
use of those who had no better weapons, ridges on the down thrown
up during the encampment, fragments of volunteer uniform, and
other such lingering remains, brought to my imagination in early
childhood the state of affairs at the date of the war more
vividly than volumes of history could have done.</p>
<p>Those who have attempted to construct a coherent narrative of
past times from the fragmentary information furnished by
survivors, are aware of the difficulty of ascertaining the true
sequence of events indiscriminately recalled.&nbsp; For this
purpose the newspapers of the date were indispensable.&nbsp; Of
other documents consulted I may mention, for the satisfaction of
those who love a true story, that the &lsquo;Address to all Ranks
and Descriptions of Englishmen&rsquo; was transcribed from an
original copy in a local museum; that the hieroglyphic portrait
of Napoleon existed as a print down to the present day in an old
woman&rsquo;s cottage near &lsquo;Overcombe;&rsquo; that the
particulars of the King&rsquo;s doings at his favourite
watering-place were augmented by details from records of the
time.&nbsp; The drilling scene of the local militia received some
additions from an account given in so grave a work as
Gifford&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of the Wars of the French
Revolution&rsquo; (London, 1817).&nbsp; But on reference to the
History I find I was mistaken in supposing the account to be
advanced as authentic, or to refer to rural England.&nbsp;
However, it does in a large degree accord with the local
traditions of such scenes that I have heard recounted, times
without number, and the system of drill was tested by reference
to the Army Regulations of 1801, and other military
handbooks.&nbsp; Almost the whole narrative of the supposed
landing of the French in the Bay is from oral relation as
aforesaid.&nbsp; Other proofs of the veracity of this chronicle
have escaped my recollection.</p>

<h2>I.&nbsp; WHAT WAS SEEN FROM THE WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE
DOWN</h2>
<p>In the days of high-waisted and muslin-gowned women, when the
vast amount of soldiering going on in the country was a cause of
much trembling to the sex, there lived in a village near the
Wessex coast two ladies of good report, though unfortunately of
limited means.&nbsp; The elder was a Mrs. Martha Garland, a
landscape-painter&rsquo;s widow, and the other was her only
daughter Anne.</p>
<p>Anne was fair, very fair, in a poetical sense; but in
complexion she was of that particular tint between blonde and
brunette which is inconveniently left without a name.&nbsp; Her
eyes were honest and inquiring, her mouth cleanly cut and yet not
classical, the middle point of her upper lip scarcely descending
so far as it should have done by rights, so that at the merest
pleasant thought, not to mention a smile, portions of two or
three white teeth were uncovered whether she would or not.&nbsp;
Some people said that this was very attractive.&nbsp; She was
graceful and slender, and, though but little above five feet in
height, could draw herself up to look tall.&nbsp; In her manner,
in her comings and goings, in her &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do
this,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do that,&rsquo; she combined
dignity with sweetness as no other girl could do; and any
impressionable stranger youths who passed by were led to yearn
for a windfall of speech from her, and to see at the same time
that they would not get it.&nbsp; In short, beneath all that was
charming and simple in this young woman there lurked a real
firmness, unperceived at first, as the speck of colour lurks
unperceived in the heart of the palest parsley flower.</p>
<p>She wore a white handkerchief to cover her white neck, and a
cap on her head with a pink ribbon round it, tied in a bow at the
front.&nbsp; She had a great variety of these cap-ribbons, the
young men being fond of sending them to her as presents until
they fell definitely in love with a special sweetheart elsewhere,
when they left off doing so.&nbsp; Between the border of her cap
and her forehead were ranged a row of round brown curls, like
swallows&rsquo; nests under eaves.</p>
<p>She lived with her widowed mother in a portion of an ancient
building formerly a manor-house, but now a mill, which, being too
large for his own requirements, the miller had found it
convenient to divide and appropriate in part to these highly
respectable tenants.&nbsp; In this dwelling Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s
and Anne&rsquo;s ears were soothed morning, noon, and night by
the music of the mill, the wheels and cogs of which, being of
wood, produced notes that might have borne in their minds a
remote resemblance to the wooden tones of the stopped diapason in
an organ. Occasionally, when the miller was bolting, there was
added to these continuous sounds the cheerful clicking of the
hopper, which did not deprive them of rest except when it was
kept going all night; and over and above all this they had the
pleasure of knowing that there crept in through every crevice,
door, and window of their dwelling, however tightly closed, a
subtle mist of superfine flour from the grinding room, quite
invisible, but making its presence known in the course of time by
giving a pallid and ghostly look to the best furniture.&nbsp; The
miller frequently apologized to his tenants for the intrusion of
this insidious dry fog; but the widow was of a friendly and
thankful nature, and she said that she did not mind it at all,
being as it was, not nasty dirt, but the blessed staff of
life.</p>
<p>By good-humour of this sort, and in other ways, Mrs. Garland
acknowledged her friendship for her neighbour, with whom Anne and
herself associated to an extent which she never could have
anticipated when, tempted by the lowness of the rent, they first
removed thither after her husband&rsquo;s death from a larger
house at the other end of the village.&nbsp; Those who have lived
in remote places where there is what is called no society will
comprehend the gradual levelling of distinctions that went on in
this case at some sacrifice of gentility on the part of one
household.&nbsp; The widow was sometimes sorry to find with what
readiness Anne caught up some dialect-word or accent from the
miller and his friends; but he was so good and true-hearted a
man, and she so easy-minded, unambitious a woman, that she would
not make life a solitude for fastidious reasons.&nbsp; More than
all, she had good ground for thinking that the miller secretly
admired her, and this added a piquancy to the situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On a fine summer morning, when the leaves were warm under the
sun, and the more industrious bees abroad, diving into every blue
and red cup that could possibly be considered a flower, Anne was
sitting at the back window of her mother&rsquo;s portion of the
house, measuring out lengths of worsted for a fringed rug that
she was making, which lay, about three-quarters finished, beside
her.&nbsp; The work, though chromatically brilliant, was tedious:
a hearth-rug was a thing which nobody worked at from morning to
night; it was taken up and put down; it was in the chair, on the
floor, across the hand-rail, under the bed, kicked here, kicked
there, rolled away in the closet, brought out again, and so on
more capriciously perhaps than any other home-made article.&nbsp;
Nobody was expected to finish a rug within a calculable period,
and the wools of the beginning became faded and historical before
the end was reached.&nbsp; A sense of this inherent nature of
worsted-work rather than idleness led Anne to look rather
frequently from the open casement.</p>
<p>Immediately before her was the large, smooth millpond,
over-full, and intruding into the hedge and into the road.&nbsp;
The water, with its flowing leaves and spots of froth, was
stealing away, like Time, under the dark arch, to tumble over the
great slimy wheel within.&nbsp; On the other side of the
mill-pond was an open place called the Cross, because it was
three-quarters of one, two lanes and a cattle-drive meeting
there.&nbsp; It was the general rendezvous and arena of the
surrounding village.&nbsp; Behind this a steep slope rose high
into the sky, merging in a wide and open down, now littered with
sheep newly shorn.&nbsp; The upland by its height completely
sheltered the mill and village from north winds, making summers
of springs, reducing winters to autumn temperatures, and
permitting myrtle to flourish in the open air.</p>
<p>The heaviness of noon pervaded the scene, and under its
influence the sheep had ceased to feed.&nbsp; Nobody was standing
at the Cross, the few inhabitants being indoors at their
dinner.&nbsp; No human being was on the down, and no human eye or
interest but Anne&rsquo;s seemed to be concerned with it.&nbsp;
The bees still worked on, and the butterflies did not rest from
roving, their smallness seeming to shield them from the
stagnating effect that this turning moment of day had on larger
creatures.&nbsp; Otherwise all was still.</p>
<p>The girl glanced at the down and the sheep for no particular
reason; the steep margin of turf and daisies rising above the
roofs, chimneys, apple-trees, and church tower of the hamlet
around her, bounded the view from her position, and it was
necessary to look somewhere when she raised her head.&nbsp; While
thus engaged in working and stopping her attention was attracted
by the sudden rising and running away of the sheep squatted on
the down; and there succeeded sounds of a heavy tramping over the
hard sod which the sheep had quitted, the tramp being accompanied
by a metallic jingle.&nbsp; Turning her eyes further she beheld
two cavalry soldiers on bulky grey chargers, armed and accoutred
throughout, ascending the down at a point to the left where the
incline was comparatively easy.&nbsp; The burnished chains,
buckles, and plates of their trappings shone like little
looking-glasses, and the blue, red, and white about them was
unsubdued by weather or wear.</p>
<p>The two troopers rode proudly on, as if nothing less than
crowns and empires ever concerned their magnificent minds.&nbsp;
They reached that part of the down which lay just in front of
her, where they came to a halt.&nbsp; In another minute there
appeared behind them a group containing some half-dozen more of
the same sort.&nbsp; These came on, halted, and dismounted
likewise.</p>
<p>Two of the soldiers then walked some distance onward together,
when one stood still, the other advancing further, and stretching
a white line of tape between them.&nbsp; Two more of the men
marched to another outlying point, where they made marks in the
ground.&nbsp; Thus they walked about and took distances,
obviously according to some preconcerted scheme.</p>
<p>At the end of this systematic proceeding one solitary
horseman&mdash;a commissioned officer, if his uniform could be
judged rightly at that distance&mdash;rode up the down, went over
the ground, looked at what the others had done, and seemed to
think that it was good.&nbsp; And then the girl heard yet louder
tramps and clankings, and she beheld rising from where the others
had risen a whole column of cavalry in marching order.&nbsp; At a
distance behind these came a cloud of dust enveloping more and
more troops, their arms and accoutrements reflecting the sun
through the haze in faint flashes, stars, and streaks of
light.&nbsp; The whole body approached slowly towards the plateau
at the top of the down.</p>
<p>Anne threw down her work, and letting her eyes remain on the
nearing masses of cavalry, the worsteds getting entangled as they
would, said, &lsquo;Mother, mother; come here!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
such a fine sight!&nbsp; What does it mean?&nbsp; What can they
be going to do up there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The mother thus invoked ran upstairs and came forward to the
window.&nbsp; She was a woman of sanguine mouth and eye, unheroic
manner, and pleasant general appearance; a little more tarnished
as to surface, but not much worse in contour than the girl
herself.</p>
<p>Widow Garland&rsquo;s thoughts were those of the period.
&lsquo;Can it be the French,&rsquo; she said, arranging herself
for the extremest form of consternation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can that
arch-enemy of mankind have landed at last?&rsquo;&nbsp; It should
be stated that at this time there were two arch-enemies of
mankind&mdash;Satan as usual, and Buonaparte, who had sprung up
and eclipsed his elder rival altogether.&nbsp; Mrs. Garland
alluded, of course, to the junior gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot be he,&rsquo; said Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah!
there&rsquo;s Simon Burden, the man who watches at the
beacon.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She waved her hand to an aged form of the same colour as the
road, who had just appeared beyond the mill-pond, and who, though
active, was bowed to that degree which almost reproaches a
feeling observer for standing upright.&nbsp; The arrival of the
soldiery had drawn him out from his drop of drink at the
&lsquo;Duke of York&rsquo; as it had attracted Anne.&nbsp; At her
call he crossed the mill-bridge, and came towards the window.</p>
<p>Anne inquired of him what it all meant; but Simon Burden,
without answering, continued to move on with parted gums, staring
at the cavalry on his own private account with a concern that
people often show about temporal phenomena when such matters can
affect them but a short time longer.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll
walk into the millpond!&rsquo; said Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are
they doing?&nbsp; You were a soldier many years ago, and ought to
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, Mis&rsquo;ess Anne,&rsquo; said the
military relic, depositing his body against the wall one limb at
a time.&nbsp; &lsquo;I were only in the foot, ye know, and never
had a clear understanding of horses.&nbsp; Ay, I be a old man,
and of no judgment now.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some additional pressure,
however, caused him to search further in his worm-eaten magazine
of ideas, and he found that he did know in a dim irresponsible
way.&nbsp; The soldiers must have come there to camp: those men
they had seen first were the markers: they had come on before the
rest to measure out the ground.&nbsp; He who had accompanied them
was the quartermaster.&nbsp; &lsquo;And so you see they have got
all the lines marked out by the time the regiment have come
up,&rsquo; he added.&nbsp; &lsquo;And then they
will&mdash;well-a-deary! who&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; supposed that
Overcombe would see such a day as this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then they will&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then&mdash; Ah, it&rsquo;s gone from me again!&rsquo;
said Simon.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, and then they will raise their tents,
you know, and picket their horses.&nbsp; That was it; so it
was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time the column of horse had ascended into full view,
and they formed a lively spectacle as they rode along the high
ground in marching order, backed by the pale blue sky, and lit by
the southerly sun.&nbsp; Their uniform was bright and attractive;
white buckskin pantaloons, three-quarter boots, scarlet shakos
set off with lace, mustachios waxed to a needle point; and above
all, those richly ornamented blue jackets mantled with the
historic pelisse&mdash;that fascination to women, and encumbrance
to the wearers themselves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the York Hussars!&rsquo; said Simon Burden,
brightening like a dying ember fanned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Foreigners to
a man, and enrolled long since my time.&nbsp; But as good hearty
comrades, they say, as you&rsquo;ll find in the King&rsquo;s
service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here are more and different ones,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Garland.</p>
<p>Other troops had, during the last few minutes, been ascending
the down at a remoter point, and now drew near.&nbsp; These were
of different weight and build from the others; lighter men, in
helmet hats, with white plumes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know which I like best,&rsquo; said
Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;These, I think, after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Simon, who had been looking hard at the latter, now said that
they were the --th Dragoons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All Englishmen they,&rsquo; said the old man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They lay at Budmouth barracks a few years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They did.&nbsp; I remember it,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Garland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And lots of the chaps about here &lsquo;listed at the
time,&rsquo; said Simon.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can call to mind that
there was&mdash;ah, &rsquo;tis gone from me again!&nbsp; However,
all that&rsquo;s of little account now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dragoons passed in front of the lookers-on as the others
had done, and their gay plumes, which had hung lazily during the
ascent, swung to northward as they reached the top, showing that
on the summit a fresh breeze blew.&nbsp; &lsquo;But look across
there,&rsquo; said Anne.&nbsp; There had entered upon the down
from another direction several battalions of foot, in white
kerseymere breeches and cloth gaiters.&nbsp; They seemed to be
weary from a long march, the original black of their gaiters and
boots being whity-brown with dust.&nbsp; Presently came
regimental waggons, and the private canteen carts which followed
at the end of a convoy.</p>
<p>The space in front of the mill-pond was now occupied by nearly
all the inhabitants of the village, who had turned out in alarm,
and remained for pleasure, their eyes lighted up with interest in
what they saw; for trappings and regimentals, war horses and men,
in towns an attraction, were here almost a sublimity.</p>
<p>The troops filed to their lines, dismounted, and in quick time
took off their accoutrements, rolled up their sheep-skins,
picketed and unbitted their horses, and made ready to erect the
tents as soon as they could be taken from the waggons and brought
forward.&nbsp; When this was done, at a given signal the canvases
flew up from the sod; and thenceforth every man had a place in
which to lay his head.</p>
<p>Though nobody seemed to be looking on but the few at the
window and in the village street, there were, as a matter of
fact, many eyes converging upon that military arrival in its high
and conspicuous position, not to mention the glances of birds and
other wild creatures.&nbsp; Men in distant gardens, women in
orchards and at cottage-doors, shepherds on remote hills,
turnip-hoers in blue-green enclosures miles away, captains with
spy-glasses out at sea, were regarding the picture keenly.&nbsp;
Those three or four thousand men of one machine-like movement,
some of them swashbucklers by nature; others, doubtless, of a
quiet shop-keeping disposition who had inadvertently got into
uniform&mdash;all of them had arrived from nobody knew where, and
hence were matter of great curiosity.&nbsp; They seemed to the
mere eye to belong to a different order of beings from those who
inhabited the valleys below.&nbsp; Apparently unconscious and
careless of what all the world was doing elsewhere, they remained
picturesquely engrossed in the business of making themselves a
habitation on the isolated spot which they had chosen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland was of a festive and sanguine turn of mind, a
woman soon set up and soon set down, and the coming of the
regiments quite excited her.&nbsp; She thought there was reason
for putting on her best cap, thought that perhaps there was not;
that she would hurry on the dinner and go out in the afternoon;
then that she would, after all, do nothing unusual, nor show any
silly excitements whatever, since they were unbecoming in a
mother and a widow.&nbsp; Thus circumscribing her intentions till
she was toned down to an ordinary person of forty, Mrs. Garland
accompanied her daughter downstairs to dine, saying,
&lsquo;Presently we will call on Miller Loveday, and hear what he
thinks of it all.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>II.&nbsp; SOMEBODY KNOCKS AND COMES IN</h2>
<p>Miller Loveday was the representative of an ancient family of
corn-grinders whose history is lost in the mists of
antiquity.&nbsp; His ancestral line was contemporaneous with that
of De Ros, Howard, and De La Zouche; but, owing to some trifling
deficiency in the possessions of the house of Loveday, the
individual names and intermarriages of its members were not
recorded during the Middle Ages, and thus their private lives in
any given century were uncertain.&nbsp; But it was known that the
family had formed matrimonial alliances with farmers not so very
small, and once with a gentleman-tanner, who had for many years
purchased after their death the horses of the most aristocratic
persons in the county&mdash;fiery steeds that earlier in their
career had been valued at many hundred guineas.</p>
<p>It was also ascertained that Mr. Loveday&rsquo;s
great-grandparents had been eight in number, and his
great-great-grandparents sixteen, every one of whom reached to
years of discretion: at every stage backwards his sires and
gammers thus doubled and doubled till they became a vast body of
Gothic ladies and gentlemen of the rank known as ceorls or
villeins, full of importance to the country at large, and
ramifying throughout the unwritten history of England.&nbsp; His
immediate father had greatly improved the value of their
residence by building a new chimney, and setting up an additional
pair of millstones.</p>
<p>Overcombe Mill presented at one end the appearance of a
hard-worked house slipping into the river, and at the other of an
idle, genteel place, half-cloaked with creepers at this time of
the year, and having no visible connexion with flour.&nbsp; It
had hips instead of gables, giving it a round-shouldered look,
four chimneys with no smoke coming out of them, two zigzag cracks
in the wall, several open windows, with a looking-glass here and
there inside, showing its warped back to the passer-by; snowy
dimity curtains waving in the draught; two mill doors, one above
the other, the upper enabling a person to step out upon nothing
at a height of ten feet from the ground; a gaping arch vomiting
the river, and a lean, long-nosed fellow looking out from the
mill doorway, who was the hired grinder, except when a bulging
fifteen stone man occupied the same place, namely, the miller
himself.</p>
<p>Behind the mill door, and invisible to the mere wayfarer who
did not visit the family, were chalked addition and subtraction
sums, many of them originally done wrong, and the figures half
rubbed out and corrected, noughts being turned into nines, and
ones into twos.&nbsp; These were the miller&rsquo;s private
calculations.&nbsp; There were also chalked in the same place
rows and rows of strokes like open palings, representing the
calculations of the grinder, who in his youthful ciphering
studies had not gone so far as Arabic figures.</p>
<p>In the court in front were two worn-out millstones, made
useful again by being let in level with the ground.&nbsp; Here
people stood to smoke and consider things in muddy weather; and
cats slept on the clean surfaces when it was hot.&nbsp; In the
large stubbard-tree at the corner of the garden was erected a
pole of larch fir, which the miller had bought with others at a
sale of small timber in Damer&rsquo;s Wood one Christmas
week.&nbsp; It rose from the upper boughs of the tree to about
the height of a fisherman&rsquo;s mast, and on the top was a vane
in the form of a sailor with his arm stretched out.&nbsp; When
the sun shone upon this figure it could be seen that the greater
part of his countenance was gone, and the paint washed from his
body so far as to reveal that he had been a soldier in red before
he became a sailor in blue.&nbsp; The image had, in fact, been
John, one of our coming characters, and was then turned into
Robert, another of them.&nbsp; This revolving piece of statuary
could not, however, be relied on as a vane, owing to the
neighbouring hill, which formed variable currents in the
wind.</p>
<p>The leafy and quieter wing of the mill-house was the part
occupied by Mrs. Garland and her daughter, who made up in
summer-time for the narrowness of their quarters by overflowing
into the garden on stools and chairs.&nbsp; The parlour or
dining-room had a stone floor&mdash;a fact which the widow sought
to disguise by double carpeting, lest the standing of Anne and
herself should be lowered in the public eye.&nbsp; Here now the
mid-day meal went lightly and mincingly on, as it does where
there is no greedy carnivorous man to keep the dishes about, and
was hanging on the close when somebody entered the passage as far
as the chink of the parlour door, and tapped.&nbsp; This
proceeding was probably adopted to kindly avoid giving trouble to
Susan, the neighbour&rsquo;s pink daughter, who helped at Mrs.
Garland&rsquo;s in the mornings, but was at that moment
particularly occupied in standing on the water-butt and gazing at
the soldiers, with an inhaling position of the mouth and circular
eyes.</p>
<p>There was a flutter in the little dining-room&mdash;the
sensitiveness of habitual solitude makes hearts beat for
preternaturally small reasons&mdash;and a guessing as to who the
visitor might be.&nbsp; It was some military gentleman from the
camp perhaps?&nbsp; No; that was impossible.&nbsp; It was the
parson?&nbsp; No; he would not come at dinner-time.&nbsp; It was
the well-informed man who travelled with drapery and the best
Birmingham earrings?&nbsp; Not at all; his time was not till
Thursday at three.&nbsp; Before they could think further the
visitor moved forward another step, and the diners got a glimpse
of him through the same friendly chink that had afforded him a
view of the Garland dinner-table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O!&nbsp; It is only Loveday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This approximation to nobody was the miller above mentioned, a
hale man of fifty-five or sixty&mdash;hale all through, as many
were in those days, and not merely veneered with purple by
exhilarating victuals and drinks, though the latter were not at
all despised by him.&nbsp; His face was indeed rather pale than
otherwise, for he had just come from the mill.&nbsp; It was
capable of immense changes of expression: mobility was its
essence, a roll of flesh forming a buttress to his nose on each
side, and a deep ravine lying between his lower lip and the
tumulus represented by his chin.&nbsp; These fleshy lumps moved
stealthily, as if of their own accord, whenever his fancy was
tickled.</p>
<p>His eyes having lighted on the table-cloth, plates, and
viands, he found himself in a position which had a sensible
awkwardness for a modest man who always liked to enter only at
seasonable times the presence of a girl of such pleasantly soft
ways as Anne Garland, she who could make apples seem like
peaches, and throw over her shillings the glamour of guineas when
she paid him for flour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dinner is over, neighbour Loveday; please come
in,&rsquo; said the widow, seeing his case.&nbsp; The miller said
something about coming in presently; but Anne pressed him to
stay, with a tender motion of her lip as it played on the verge
of a solicitous smile without quite lapsing into one&mdash;her
habitual manner when speaking.</p>
<p>Loveday took off his low-crowned hat and advanced.&nbsp; He
had not come about pigs or fowls this time.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
been looking out, like the rest o&rsquo; us, no doubt, Mrs.
Garland, at the mampus of soldiers that have come upon the
down?&nbsp; Well, one of the horse regiments is the --th
Dragoons, my son John&rsquo;s regiment, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The announcement, though it interested them, did not create
such an effect as the father of John had seemed to anticipate;
but Anne, who liked to say pleasant things, replied, &lsquo;The
dragoons looked nicer than the foot, or the German cavalry
either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are a handsome body of men,&rsquo; said the miller
in a disinterested voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Faith! I didn&rsquo;t know
they were coming, though it may be in the newspaper all the
time.&nbsp; But old Derriman keeps it so long that we never know
things till they be in everybody&rsquo;s mouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This Derriman was a squireen living near, who was chiefly
distinguished in the present warlike time by having a nephew in
the yeomanry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We were told that the yeomanry went along the turnpike
road yesterday,&rsquo; said Anne; &lsquo;and they say that they
were a pretty sight, and quite soldierly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! well&mdash;they be not regulars,&rsquo; said Miller
Loveday, keeping back harsher criticism as uncalled for.&nbsp;
But inflamed by the arrival of the dragoons, which had been the
exciting cause of his call, his mind would not go to
yeomanry.&nbsp; &lsquo;John has not been home these five
years,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what rank does he hold now?&rsquo; said the
widow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s trumpet-major, ma&rsquo;am; and a good
musician.&rsquo;&nbsp; The miller, who was a good father, went on
to explain that John had seen some service, too.&nbsp; He had
enlisted when the regiment was lying in this neighbourhood, more
than eleven years before, which put his father out of temper with
him, as he had wished him to follow on at the mill.&nbsp; But as
the lad had enlisted seriously, and as he had often said that he
would be a soldier, the miller had thought that he would let Jack
take his chance in the profession of his choice.</p>
<p>Loveday had two sons, and the second was now brought into the
conversation by a remark of Anne&rsquo;s that neither of them
seemed to care for the miller&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Loveday in a less buoyant tone.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Robert, you see, must needs go to sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is much younger than his brother?&rsquo; said Mrs.
Garland.</p>
<p>About four years, the miller told her.&nbsp; His soldier son
was two-and-thirty, and Bob was twenty-eight.&nbsp; When Bob
returned from his present voyage, he was to be persuaded to stay
and assist as grinder in the mill, and go to sea no more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A sailor-miller!&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, he knows as much about mill business as I do,&rsquo;
said Loveday; &lsquo;he was intended for it, you know, like
John.&nbsp; But, bless me!&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;I am
before my story.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m come more particularly to ask
you, ma&rsquo;am, and you, Anne my honey, if you will join me and
a few friends at a leetle homely supper that I shall gi&rsquo;e
to please the chap now he&rsquo;s come?&nbsp; I can do no less
than have a bit of a randy, as the saying is, now that he&rsquo;s
here safe and sound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland wanted to catch her daughter&rsquo;s eye; she was
in some doubt about her answer.&nbsp; But Anne&rsquo;s eye was
not to be caught, for she hated hints, nods, and calculations of
any kind in matters which should be regulated by impulse; and the
matron replied, &lsquo;If so be &rsquo;tis possible, we&rsquo;ll
be there.&nbsp; You will tell us the day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He would, as soon as he had seen son John.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Twill be rather untidy, you know, owing to my
having no womenfolks in the house; and my man David is a poor
dunder-headed feller for getting up a feast.&nbsp; Poor chap! his
sight is bad, that&rsquo;s true, and he&rsquo;s very good at
making the beds, and oiling the legs of the chairs and other
furniture, or I should have got rid of him years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should have a woman to attend to the house,
Loveday,&rsquo; said the widow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I should, but&mdash;.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis a
fine day, neighbours.&nbsp; Hark!&nbsp; I fancy I hear the noise
of pots and pans up at the camp, or my ears deceive me.&nbsp;
Poor fellows, they must be hungry!&nbsp; Good day t&rsquo;ye,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the miller went away.</p>
<p>All that afternoon Overcombe continued in a ferment of
interest in the military investment, which brought the excitement
of an invasion without the strife.&nbsp; There were great
discussions on the merits and appearance of the soldiery.&nbsp;
The event opened up, to the girls unbounded possibilities of
adoring and being adored, and to the young men an embarrassment
of dashing acquaintances which quite superseded falling in
love.&nbsp; Thirteen of these lads incontinently stated within
the space of a quarter of an hour that there was nothing in the
world like going for a soldier.&nbsp; The young women stated
little, but perhaps thought the more; though, in justice, they
glanced round towards the encampment from the corners of their
blue and brown eyes in the most demure and modest manner that
could be desired.</p>
<p>In the evening the village was lively with soldiers&rsquo;
wives; a tree full of starlings would not have rivalled the
chatter that was going on.&nbsp; These ladies were very
brilliantly dressed, with more regard for colour than for
material.&nbsp; Purple, red, and blue bonnets were numerous, with
bunches of cocks&rsquo; feathers; and one had on an Arcadian hat
of green sarcenet, turned up in front to show her cap
underneath.&nbsp; It had once belonged to an officer&rsquo;s
lady, and was not so much stained, except where the occasional
storms of rain, incidental to a military life, had caused the
green to run and stagnate in curious watermarks like peninsulas
and islands.&nbsp; Some of the prettiest of these butterfly wives
had been fortunate enough to get lodgings in the cottages, and
were thus spared the necessity of living in huts and tents on the
down.&nbsp; Those who had not been so fortunate were not rendered
more amiable by the success of their sisters-in-arms, and called
them names which brought forth retorts and rejoinders; till the
end of these alternative remarks seemed dependent upon the close
of the day.</p>
<p>One of these new arrivals, who had a rosy nose and a slight
thickness of voice, which, as Anne said, she couldn&rsquo;t help,
poor thing, seemed to have seen so much of the world, and to have
been in so many campaigns, that Anne would have liked to take her
into their own house, so as to acquire some of that practical
knowledge of the history of England which the lady possessed, and
which could not be got from books.&nbsp; But the narrowness of
Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s rooms absolutely forbade this, and the
houseless treasury of experience was obliged to look for quarters
elsewhere.</p>
<p>That night Anne retired early to bed.&nbsp; The events of the
day, cheerful as they were in themselves, had been unusual enough
to give her a slight headache.&nbsp; Before getting into bed she
went to the window, and lifted the white curtains that hung
across it.&nbsp; The moon was shining, though not as yet into the
valley, but just peeping above the ridge of the down, where the
white cones of the encampment were softly touched by its
light.&nbsp; The quarter-guard and foremost tents showed
themselves prominently; but the body of the camp, the
officers&rsquo; tents, kitchens, canteen, and appurtenances in
the rear were blotted out by the ground, because of its height
above her.&nbsp; She could discern the forms of one or two
sentries moving to and fro across the disc of the moon at
intervals.&nbsp; She could hear the frequent shuffling and
tossing of the horses tied to the pickets; and in the other
direction the miles-long voice of the sea, whispering a louder
note at those points of its length where hampered in its ebb and
flow by some jutting promontory or group of boulders.&nbsp;
Louder sounds suddenly broke this approach to silence; they came
from the camp of dragoons, were taken up further to the right by
the camp of the Hanoverians, and further on still by the body of
infantry.&nbsp; It was tattoo.&nbsp; Feeling no desire to sleep,
she listened yet longer, looked at Charles&rsquo;s Wain swinging
over the church tower, and the moon ascending higher and higher
over the right-hand streets of tents, where, instead of parade
and bustle, there was nothing going on but snores and dreams, the
tired soldiers lying by this time under their proper canvases,
radiating like spokes from the pole of each tent.</p>
<p>At last Anne gave up thinking, and retired like the
rest.&nbsp; The night wore on, and, except the occasional
&lsquo;All&rsquo;s well&rsquo; of the sentries, no voice was
heard in the camp or in the village below.</p>
<h2>III.&nbsp; THE MILL BECOMES AN IMPORTANT CENTRE OF
OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>The next morning Miss Garland awoke with an impression that
something more than usual was going on, and she recognized as
soon as she could clearly reason that the proceedings, whatever
they might be, lay not far away from her bedroom window.&nbsp;
The sounds were chiefly those of pickaxes and shovels.&nbsp; Anne
got up, and, lifting the corner of the curtain about an inch,
peeped out.</p>
<p>A number of soldiers were busily engaged in making a zigzag
path down the incline from the camp to the river-head at the back
of the house, and judging from the quantity of work already got
through they must have begun very early.&nbsp; Squads of men were
working at several equidistant points in the proposed pathway,
and by the time that Anne had dressed herself each section of the
length had been connected with those above and below it, so that
a continuous and easy track was formed from the crest of the down
to the bottom of the steep.</p>
<p>The down rested on a bed of solid chalk, and the surface
exposed by the roadmakers formed a white ribbon, serpenting from
top to bottom.</p>
<p>Then the relays of working soldiers all disappeared, and, not
long after, a troop of dragoons in watering order rode forward at
the top and began to wind down the new path.&nbsp; They came
lower and closer, and at last were immediately beneath her
window, gathering themselves up on the space by the
mill-pond.&nbsp; A number of the horses entered it at the shallow
part, drinking and splashing and tossing about.&nbsp; Perhaps as
many as thirty, half of them with riders on their backs, were in
the water at one time; the thirsty animals drank, stamped,
flounced, and drank again, letting the clear, cool water dribble
luxuriously from their mouths.&nbsp; Miller Loveday was looking
on from over his garden hedge, and many admiring villagers were
gathered around.</p>
<p>Gazing up higher, Anne saw other troops descending by the new
road from the camp, those which had already been to the pond
making room for these by withdrawing along the village lane and
returning to the top by a circuitous route.</p>
<p>Suddenly the miller exclaimed, as in fulfilment of
expectation, &lsquo;Ah, John, my boy; good morning!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And the reply of &lsquo;Morning, father,&rsquo; came from a
well-mounted soldier near him, who did not, however, form one of
the watering party.&nbsp; Anne could not see his face very
clearly, but she had no doubt that this was John Loveday.</p>
<p>There were tones in the voice which reminded her of old times,
those of her very infancy, when Johnny Loveday had been top boy
in the village school, and had wanted to learn painting of her
father.&nbsp; The deeps and shallows of the mill-pond being
better known to him than to any other man in the camp, he had
apparently come down on that account, and was cautioning some of
the horsemen against riding too far in towards the mill-head.</p>
<p>Since her childhood and his enlistment Anne had seen him only
once, and then but casually, when he was home on a short
furlough.&nbsp; His figure was not much changed from what it had
been; but the many sunrises and sunsets which had passed since
that day, developing her from a comparative child to womanhood,
had abstracted some of his angularities, reddened his skin, and
given him a foreign look.&nbsp; It was interesting to see what
years of training and service had done for this man.&nbsp; Few
would have supposed that the white and the blue coats of miller
and soldier covered the forms of father and son.</p>
<p>Before the last troop of dragoons rode off they were welcomed
in a body by Miller Loveday, who still stood in his outer garden,
this being a plot lying below the mill-tail, and stretching to
the water-side.&nbsp; It was just the time of year when cherries
are ripe, and hang in clusters under their dark leaves.&nbsp;
While the troopers loitered on their horses, and chatted to the
miller across the stream, he gathered bunches of the fruit, and
held them up over the garden hedge for the acceptance of anybody
who would have them; whereupon the soldiers rode into the water
to where it had washed holes in the garden bank, and, reining
their horses there, caught the cherries in their forage-caps, or
received bunches of them on the ends of their switches, with the
dignified laugh that became martial men when stooping to slightly
boyish amusement.&nbsp; It was a cheerful, careless,
unpremeditated half-hour, which returned like the scent of a
flower to the memories of some of those who enjoyed it, even at a
distance of many years after, when they lay wounded and weak in
foreign lands.</p>
<p>Then dragoons and horses wheeled off as the others had done;
and troops of the German Legion next came down and entered in
panoramic procession the space below Anne&rsquo;s eyes, as if on
purpose to gratify her.&nbsp; These were notable by their
mustachios, and queues wound tightly with brown ribbon to the
level of their broad shoulder-blades.&nbsp; They were charmed, as
the others had been, by the head and neck of Miss Garland in the
little square window overlooking the scene of operations, and
saluted her with devoted foreign civility, and in such
overwhelming numbers that the modest girl suddenly withdrew
herself into the room, and had a private blush between the chest
of drawers and the washing-stand.</p>
<p>When she came downstairs her mother said, &lsquo;I have been
thinking what I ought to wear to Miller Loveday&rsquo;s
to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Miller Loveday&rsquo;s?&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; The party is to-night.&nbsp; He has been in
here this morning to tell me that he has seen his son, and they
have fixed this evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think we ought to go, mother?&rsquo; said Anne
slowly, and looking at the smaller features of the
window-flowers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will only have men there except ourselves, will
he?&nbsp; And shall we be right to go alone among
&rsquo;em?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne had not recovered from the ardent gaze of the gallant
York Hussars, whose voices reached her even now in converse with
Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;La, Anne, how proud you are!&rsquo; said Widow
Garland.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, isn&rsquo;t he our nearest neighbour
and our landlord? and don&rsquo;t he always fetch our faggots
from the wood, and keep us in vegetables for next to
nothing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t be distant with the man.&nbsp; And
if the enemy land next autumn, as everybody says they will, we
shall have quite to depend upon the miller&rsquo;s waggon and
horses.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s our only friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, so he is,&rsquo; said Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you
had better go, mother; and I&rsquo;ll stay at home.&nbsp; They
will be all men; and I don&rsquo;t like going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland reflected.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t
want to go, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps,
as you are growing up, it would be better to stay at home this
time.&nbsp; Your father was a professional man,
certainly.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having spoken as a mother, she sighed as
a woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you sigh, mother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are so prim and stiff about everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well&mdash;we&rsquo;ll go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;I am not sure that we ought.&nbsp; I did not
promise, and there will be no trouble in keeping away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne apparently did not feel certain of her own opinion, and,
instead of supporting or contradicting, looked thoughtfully down,
and abstractedly brought her hands together on her bosom, till
her fingers met tip to tip.</p>
<p>As the day advanced the young woman and her mother became
aware that great preparations were in progress in the
miller&rsquo;s wing of the house.&nbsp; The partitioning between
the Lovedays and the Garlands was not very thorough, consisting
in many cases of a simple screwing up of the doors in the
dividing walls; and thus when the mill began any new performances
they proclaimed themselves at once in the more private
dwelling.&nbsp; The smell of Miller Loveday&rsquo;s pipe came
down Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s chimney of an evening with the greatest
regularity.&nbsp; Every time that he poked his fire they knew
from the vehemence or deliberateness of the blows the precise
state of his mind; and when he wound his clock on Sunday nights
the whirr of that monitor reminded the widow to wind hers.&nbsp;
This transit of noises was most perfect where Loveday&rsquo;s
lobby adjoined Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s pantry; and Anne, who was
occupied for some time in the latter apartment, enjoyed the
privilege of hearing the visitors arrive and of catching stray
sounds and words without the connecting phrases that made them
entertaining, to judge from the laughter they evoked.&nbsp; The
arrivals passed through the house and went into the garden, where
they had tea in a large summer-house, an occasional blink of
bright colour, through the foliage, being all that was visible of
the assembly from Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s windows.&nbsp; When it
grew dusk they all could be heard coming indoors to finish the
evening in the parlour.</p>
<p>Then there was an intensified continuation of the
above-mentioned signs of enjoyment, talkings and haw-haws,
runnings upstairs and runnings down, a slamming of doors and a
clinking of cups and glasses; till the proudest adjoining tenant
without friends on his own side of the partition might have been
tempted to wish for entrance to that merry dwelling, if only to
know the cause of these fluctuations of hilarity, and to see if
the guests were really so numerous, and the observations so very
amusing as they seemed.</p>
<p>The stagnation of life on the Garland side of the party-wall
began to have a very gloomy effect by the contrast.&nbsp; When,
about half-past nine o&rsquo;clock, one of these tantalizing
bursts of gaiety had resounded for a longer time than usual, Anne
said, &lsquo;I believe, mother, that you are wishing you had
gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I own to feeling that it would have been very cheerful
if we had joined in,&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland, in a hankering
tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was rather too nice in listening to you and
not going.&nbsp; The parson never calls upon us except in his
spiritual capacity.&nbsp; Old Derriman is hardly genteel; and
there&rsquo;s nobody left to speak to.&nbsp; Lonely people must
accept what company they can get.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or do without it altogether.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not natural, Anne; and I am surprised to
hear a young woman like you say such a thing.&nbsp; Nature will
not be stifled in that way. . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; (Song and powerful
chorus heard through partition.)&nbsp; &lsquo;I declare the room
on the other side of the wall seems quite a paradise compared
with this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother, you are quite a girl,&rsquo; said Anne in
slightly superior accents.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go in and join them by
all means.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;not now,&rsquo; said her mother, resignedly
shaking her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is too late now.&nbsp; We ought
to have taken advantage of the invitation.&nbsp; They would look
hard at me as a poor mortal who had no real business there, and
the miller would say, with his broad smile, &ldquo;Ah, you be
obliged to come round.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>While the sociable and unaspiring Mrs. Garland continued thus
to pass the evening in two places, her body in her own house and
her mind in the miller&rsquo;s, somebody knocked at the door, and
directly after the elder Loveday himself was admitted to the
room.&nbsp; He was dressed in a suit between grand and gay, which
he used for such occasions as the present, and his blue coat,
yellow and red waistcoat with the three lower buttons unfastened,
steel-buckled shoes and speckled stockings, became him very well
in Mrs. Martha Garland&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your servant, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the miller,
adopting as a matter of propriety the raised standard of
politeness required by his higher costume.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,
begging your pardon, I can&rsquo;t hae this.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
unnatural that you two ladies should be biding here and we under
the same roof making merry without ye.&nbsp; Your husband, poor
man&mdash;lovely picters that a&rsquo; would make to be
sure&mdash;would have been in with us long ago if he had been in
your place.&nbsp; I can take no nay from ye, upon my
honour.&nbsp; You and maidy Anne must come in, if it be only for
half-an-hour.&nbsp; John and his friends have got passes till
twelve o&rsquo;clock to-night, and, saving a few of our own
village folk, the lowest visitor present is a very genteel German
corporal.&nbsp; If you should hae any misgivings on the score of
respectability, ma&rsquo;am, we&rsquo;ll pack off the underbred
ones into the back kitchen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Widow Garland and Anne looked yes at each other after this
appeal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll follow you in a few minutes,&rsquo; said
the elder, smiling; and she rose with Anne to go upstairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll wait for ye,&rsquo; said the miller
doggedly; &lsquo;or perhaps you&rsquo;ll alter your mind
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While the mother and daughter were upstairs dressing, and
saying laughingly to each other, &lsquo;Well, we must go
now,&rsquo; as if they hadn&rsquo;t wished to go all the evening,
other steps were heard in the passage; and the miller cried from
below, &lsquo;Your pardon, Mrs. Garland; but my son John has come
to help fetch ye.&nbsp; Shall I ask him in till ye be
ready?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly; I shall be down in a minute,&rsquo; screamed
Anne&rsquo;s mother in a slanting voice towards the
staircase.</p>
<p>When she descended, the outline of the trumpet-major appeared
half-way down the passage.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is John,&rsquo; said
the miller simply.&nbsp; &lsquo;John, you can mind Mrs. Martha
Garland very well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, indeed,&rsquo; said the dragoon, coming in a
little further.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should have called to see her last
time, but I was only home a week.&nbsp; How is your little girl,
ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland said Anne was quite well.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is
grown-up now.&nbsp; She will be down in a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight noise of military heels without the door,
at which the trumpet-major went and put his head outside, and
said, &lsquo;All right&mdash;coming in a minute,&rsquo; when
voices in the darkness replied, &lsquo;No hurry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More friends?&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, it is only Buck and Jones come to fetch me,&rsquo;
said the soldier.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall I ask &rsquo;em in a minute,
Mrs Garland, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said the lady; and the two interesting
forms of Trumpeter Buck and Saddler-sergeant Jones then came
forward in the most friendly manner; whereupon other steps were
heard without, and it was discovered that Sergeant-master-tailor
Brett and Farrier-extraordinary Johnson were outside, having come
to fetch Messrs. Buck and Jones, as Buck and Jones had come to
fetch the trumpet-major.</p>
<p>As there seemed a possibility of Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s small
passage being choked up with human figures personally unknown to
her, she was relieved to hear Anne coming downstairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s my little girl,&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland,
and the trumpet-major looked with a sort of awe upon the muslin
apparition who came forward, and stood quite dumb before
her.&nbsp; Anne recognized him as the trooper she had seen from
her window, and welcomed him kindly.&nbsp; There was something in
his honest face which made her feel instantly at home with
him.</p>
<p>At this frankness of manner Loveday&mdash;who was not a
ladies&rsquo; man&mdash;blushed, and made some alteration in his
bodily posture, began a sentence which had no end, and showed
quite a boy&rsquo;s embarrassment.&nbsp; Recovering himself, he
politely offered his arm, which Anne took with a very pretty
grace.&nbsp; He conducted her through his comrades, who glued
themselves perpendicularly to the wall to let her pass, and then
they went out of the door, her mother following with the miller,
and supported by the body of troopers, the latter walking with
the usual cavalry gait, as if their thighs were rather too long
for them.&nbsp; Thus they crossed the threshold of the mill-house
and up the passage, the paving of which was worn into a gutter by
the ebb and flow of feet that had been going on there ever since
Tudor times.</p>
<h2>IV.&nbsp; WHO WERE PRESENT AT THE MILLER&rsquo;S LITTLE
ENTERTAINMENT</h2>
<p>When the group entered the presence of the company a lull in
the conversation was caused by the sight of new visitors, and (of
course) by the charm of Anne&rsquo;s appearance; until the old
men, who had daughters of their own, perceiving that she was only
a half-formed girl, resumed their tales and toss-potting with
unconcern.</p>
<p>Miller Loveday had fraternized with half the soldiers in the
camp since their arrival, and the effect of this upon his party
was striking&mdash;both chromatically and otherwise.&nbsp; Those
among the guests who first attracted the eye were the sergeants
and sergeant-majors of Loveday&rsquo;s regiment, fine hearty men,
who sat facing the candles, entirely resigned to physical
comfort.&nbsp; Then there were other non-commissioned officers, a
German, two Hungarians, and a Swede, from the foreign
hussars&mdash;young men with a look of sadness on their faces, as
if they did not much like serving so far from home.&nbsp; All of
them spoke English fairly well.&nbsp; Old age was represented by
Simon Burden the pensioner, and the shady side of fifty by
Corporal Tullidge, his friend and neighbour, who was hard of
hearing, and sat with his hat on over a red cotton handkerchief
that was wound several times round his head.&nbsp; These two
veterans were employed as watchers at the neighbouring beacon,
which had lately been erected by the Lord-Lieutenant for firing
whenever the descent on the coast should be made.&nbsp; They
lived in a little hut on the hill, close by the heap of faggots;
but to-night they had found deputies to watch in their stead.</p>
<p>On a lower plane of experience and qualifications came
neighbour James Comfort, of the Volunteers, a soldier by
courtesy, but a blacksmith by rights; also William Tremlett and
Anthony Cripplestraw, of the local forces.&nbsp; The two latter
men of war were dressed merely as villagers, and looked upon the
regulars from a humble position in the background.&nbsp; The
remainder of the party was made up of a neighbouring dairyman or
two, and their wives, invited by the miller, as Anne was glad to
see, that she and her mother should not be the only women
there.</p>
<p>The elder Loveday apologized in a whisper to Mrs. Garland for
the presence of the inferior villagers.&nbsp; &lsquo;But as they
are learning to be brave defenders of their home and country,
ma&rsquo;am, as fast as they can master the drill, and have
worked for me off and on these many years, I&rsquo;ve asked
&rsquo;em in, and thought you&rsquo;d excuse it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, Miller Loveday,&rsquo; said the widow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the same of old Burden and Tullidge.&nbsp; They
have served well and long in the Foot, and even now have a hard
time of it up at the beacon in wet weather.&nbsp; So after giving
them a meal in the kitchen I just asked &rsquo;em in to hear the
singing.&nbsp; They faithfully promise that as soon as ever the
gunboats appear in view, and they have fired the beacon, to run
down here first, in case we shouldn&rsquo;t see it.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis worth while to be friendly with &rsquo;em, you see,
though their tempers be queer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite worth while, miller,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>Anne was rather embarrassed by the presence of the regular
military in such force, and at first confined her words to the
dairymen&rsquo;s wives she was acquainted with, and to the two
old soldiers of the parish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t ye speak to me afore, chiel?&rsquo;
said one of these, Corporal Tullidge, the elderly man with the
hat, while she was talking to old Simon Burden.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
met ye in the lane yesterday,&rsquo; he added reproachfully,
&lsquo;but ye didn&rsquo;t notice me at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry for it,&rsquo; she said; but, being
afraid to shout in such a company, the effect of her remark upon
the corporal was as if she had not spoken at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You was coming along with yer head full of some high
notions or other no doubt,&rsquo; continued the uncompromising
corporal in the same loud voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, &rsquo;tis the
young bucks that get all the notice nowadays, and old folks are
quite forgot!&nbsp; I can mind well enough how young Bob Loveday
used to lie in wait for ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne blushed deeply, and stopped his too excursive discourse
by hastily saying that she always respected old folks like
him.&nbsp; The corporal thought she inquired why he always kept
his hat on, and answered that it was because his head was injured
at Valenciennes, in July, Ninety-three.&nbsp; &lsquo;We were
trying to bomb down the tower, and a piece of the shell struck
me.&nbsp; I was no more nor less than a dead man for two
days.&nbsp; If it hadn&rsquo;t a been for that and my smashed arm
I should have come home none the worse for my five-and-twenty
years&rsquo; service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have got a silver plate let into yer head,
haven&rsquo;t ye, corpel?&rsquo; said Anthony Cripplestraw, who
had drawn near.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have heard that the way they
morticed yer skull was a beautiful piece of workmanship.&nbsp;
Perhaps the young woman would like to see the place?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a curious sight, Mis&rsquo;ess Anne; you don&rsquo;t
see such a wownd every day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; said Anne hurriedly, dreading, as
did all the young people of Overcombe, the spectacle of the
corporal uncovered.&nbsp; He had never been seen in public
without the hat and the handkerchief since his return in
Ninety-four; and strange stories were told of the ghastliness of
his appearance bare-headed, a little boy who had accidentally
beheld him going to bed in that state having been frightened into
fits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if the young woman don&rsquo;t want to see yer
head, maybe she&rsquo;d like to hear yer arm?&rsquo; continued
Cripplestraw, earnest to please her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey?&rsquo; said the corporal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your arm hurt too?&rsquo; cried Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Knocked to a pummy at the same time as my head,&rsquo;
said Tullidge dispassionately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rattle yer arm, corpel, and show her,&rsquo; said
Cripplestraw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sure,&rsquo; said the corporal, raising the limb
slowly, as if the glory of exhibition had lost some of its
novelty, though he was willing to oblige.&nbsp; Twisting it
mercilessly about with his right hand he produced a crunching
among the bones at every motion, Cripplestraw seeming to derive
great satisfaction from the ghastly sound.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How very shocking!&rsquo; said Anne, painfully anxious
for him to leave off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, it don&rsquo;t hurt him, bless ye.&nbsp; Do it,
corpel?&rsquo; said Cripplestraw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit,&rsquo; said the corporal, still working his
arm with great energy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no life in the bones at all.&nbsp; No
life in &rsquo;em, I tell her, corpel!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They be as loose as a bag of ninepins,&rsquo; explained
Cripplestraw in continuation.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can feel &rsquo;em
quite plain, Mis&rsquo;ess Anne.&nbsp; If ye would like to,
he&rsquo;ll undo his sleeve in a minute to oblege ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no, please not!&nbsp; I quite understand,&rsquo;
said the young woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do she want to hear or see any more, or don&rsquo;t
she?&rsquo; the corporal inquired, with a sense that his time was
getting wasted.</p>
<p>Anne explained that she did not on any account; and managed to
escape from the corner.</p>
<h2>V.&nbsp; THE SONG AND THE STRANGER</h2>
<p>The trumpet-major now contrived to place himself near her,
Anne&rsquo;s presence having evidently been a great pleasure to
him since the moment of his first seeing her.&nbsp; She was quite
at her ease with him, and asked him if he thought that Buonaparte
would really come during the summer, and many other questions
which the gallant dragoon could not answer, but which he
nevertheless liked to be asked.&nbsp; William Tremlett, who had
not enjoyed a sound night&rsquo;s rest since the First
Consul&rsquo;s menace had become known, pricked up his ears at
sound of this subject, and inquired if anybody had seen the
terrible flat-bottomed boats that the enemy were to cross in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brother Robert saw several of them paddling about
the shore the last time he passed the Straits of Dover,&rsquo;
said the trumpet-major; and he further startled the company by
informing them that there were supposed to be more than fifteen
hundred of these boats, and that they would carry a hundred men
apiece.&nbsp; So that a descent of one hundred and fifty thousand
men might be expected any day as soon as Boney had brought his
plans to bear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord ha&rsquo; mercy upon us!&rsquo; said William
Tremlett.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The night-time is when they will try it, if they try it
at all,&rsquo; said old Tullidge, in the tone of one whose watch
at the beacon must, in the nature of things, have given him
comprehensive views of the situation.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is my
belief that the point they will choose for making the shore is
just over there,&rsquo; and he nodded with indifference towards a
section of the coast at a hideous nearness to the house in which
they were assembled, whereupon Fencible Tremlett, and
Cripplestraw of the Locals, tried to show no signs of
trepidation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When d&rsquo;ye think &rsquo;twill be?&rsquo; said
Volunteer Comfort, the blacksmith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t answer to a day,&rsquo; said the
corporal, &lsquo;but it will certainly be in a down-channel tide;
and instead of pulling hard against it, he&rsquo;ll let his boats
drift, and that will bring &rsquo;em right into Budmouth
Bay.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be a beautiful stroke of war, if so be
&rsquo;tis quietly done!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beautiful,&rsquo; said Cripplestraw, moving inside his
clothes.&nbsp; &lsquo;But how if we should be all abed,
corpel?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t expect a man to be brave in his
shirt, especially we Locals, that have only got so far as
shoulder fire-locks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not coming this summer.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
never come at all,&rsquo; said a tall sergeant-major
decisively.</p>
<p>Loveday the soldier was too much engaged in attending upon
Anne and her mother to join in these surmises, bestirring himself
to get the ladies some of the best liquor the house afforded,
which had, as a matter of fact, crossed the Channel as privately
as Buonaparte wished his army to do, and had been landed on a
dark night over the cliff.&nbsp; After this he asked Anne to
sing, but though she had a very pretty voice in private
performances of that nature, she declined to oblige him; turning
the subject by making a hesitating inquiry about his brother
Robert, whom he had mentioned just before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert is as well as ever, thank you, Miss
Garland,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is now mate of the brig
Pewit&mdash;rather young for such a command; but the owner puts
great trust in him.&rsquo;&nbsp; The trumpet-major added,
deepening his thoughts to a profounder view of the person
discussed, &lsquo;Bob is in love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne looked conscious, and listened attentively; but Loveday
did not go on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t exactly say.&nbsp; And the strange part
of it is that he never tells us who the woman is.&nbsp; Nobody
knows at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will tell, of course?&rsquo; said Anne, in the
remote tone of a person with whose sex such matters had no
connexion whatever.</p>
<p>Loveday shook his head, and the tete-a-tete was put an end to
by a burst of singing from one of the sergeants, who was followed
at the end of his song by others, each giving a ditty in his
turn; the singer standing up in front of the table, stretching
his chin well into the air, as though to abstract every possible
wrinkle from his throat, and then plunging into the melody.&nbsp;
When this was over one of the foreign hussars&mdash;the genteel
German of Miller Loveday&rsquo;s description, who called himself
a Hungarian, and in reality belonged to no definite
country&mdash;performed at Trumpet-major Loveday&rsquo;s request
the series of wild motions that he denominated his national
dance, that Anne might see what it was like.&nbsp; Miss Garland
was the flower of the whole company; the soldiers one and all,
foreign and English, seemed to be quite charmed by her presence,
as indeed they well might be, considering how seldom they came
into the society of such as she.</p>
<p>Anne and her mother were just thinking of retiring to their
own dwelling when Sergeant Stanner of the --th Foot, who was
recruiting at Budmouth, began a satirical song:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>When law&rsquo;-yers strive&rsquo; to heal&rsquo;
a breach&rsquo;,<br />
And par-sons prac&rsquo;-tise what&rsquo; they preach&rsquo;;<br
/>
Then lit&rsquo;-tle Bo-ney he&rsquo;ll pounce down&rsquo;,<br />
And march&rsquo; his men&rsquo; on Lon&rsquo;-don
town&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Chorus.&mdash;Rol&rsquo;-li-cum ro&rsquo;-rum,
tol&rsquo;-lol-lo&rsquo;-rum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rol&rsquo;-li-cum ro&rsquo;-rum,
tol&rsquo;-lol-lay.</p>
<p>When jus&rsquo;-ti-ces&rsquo; hold e&rsquo;qual
scales&rsquo;,<br />
And rogues&rsquo; are on&rsquo;-ly found&rsquo; in
jails&rsquo;;<br />
Then lit&rsquo;tle Bo&rsquo;-ney he&rsquo;ll pounce
down&rsquo;,<br />
And march&rsquo; his men&rsquo; on Lon&rsquo;-don
town&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Chorus.&mdash;Rol&rsquo;-li-cum ro&rsquo;-rum,
tol&rsquo;-lol-lo&rsquo;-rum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rol&rsquo;-li-cum ro&rsquo;-rum,
tol&rsquo;-lol-lay.</p>
<p>When rich&rsquo; men find&rsquo; their wealth&rsquo; a
curse&rsquo;,<br />
And fill&rsquo; there-with&rsquo; the poor&rsquo; man&rsquo;s
purse&rsquo;;<br />
Then lit&rsquo;-tle Bo&rsquo;-ney he&rsquo;ll pounce
down&rsquo;,<br />
And march&rsquo; his men&rsquo; on Lon&rsquo;-don
town&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Chorus.&mdash;Rol&rsquo;-li-cum ro&rsquo;-rum,
tol&rsquo;-lol-lo&rsquo;-rum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rol&rsquo;-li-cum ro&rsquo;-rum,
tol&rsquo;-lol-lay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor Stanner! In spite of his satire, he fell at the bloody
battle of Albuera a few years after this pleasantly spent summer
at the Georgian watering-place, being mortally wounded and
trampled down by a French hussar when the brigade was deploying
into line under Beresford.</p>
<p>While Miller Loveday was saying &lsquo;Well done, Mr.
Stanner!&rsquo; at the close of the thirteenth stanza, which
seemed to be the last, and Mr. Stanner was modestly expressing
his regret that he could do no better, a stentorian voice was
heard outside the window shutter repeating,</p>
<blockquote><p>Rol&rsquo;-li-cum ro&rsquo;-rum,
tol&rsquo;-lol-lo&rsquo;-rum,<br />
Rol&rsquo;-li-cum ro&rsquo;-rum, tol&rsquo;-lol-lay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company was silent in a moment at this reinforcement, and
only the military tried not to look surprised.&nbsp; While all
wondered who the singer could be somebody entered the porch; the
door opened, and in came a young man, about the size and weight
of the Farnese Hercules, in the uniform of the yeomanry
cavalry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis young Squire Derriman, old Mr.
Derriman&rsquo;s nephew,&rsquo; murmured voices in the
background.</p>
<p>Without waiting to address anybody, or apparently seeing who
were gathered there, the colossal man waved his cap above his
head and went on in tones that shook the window-panes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>When hus&rsquo;-bands with&rsquo; their
wives&rsquo; agree&rsquo;.<br />
And maids&rsquo; won&rsquo;t wed&rsquo; from
mod&rsquo;-es-ty&rsquo;,<br />
Then lit&rsquo;-tle Bo&rsquo;-ney he&rsquo;ll pounce
down&rsquo;,<br />
And march&rsquo; his men&rsquo; on Lon&rsquo;-don
town&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Chorus.&mdash;Rol&rsquo;-li-cum ro&rsquo;-rum,
tol&rsquo;-lol-lo&rsquo;-rum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rol&rsquo;-li-cum ro&rsquo;-rum,
tol&rsquo;-lol-lay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a verse which had been omitted by the gallant Stanner,
out of respect to the ladies.</p>
<p>The new-comer was red-haired and of florid complexion, and
seemed full of a conviction that his whim of entering must be
their pleasure, which for the moment it was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No ceremony, good men all,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I was
passing by, and my ear was caught by the singing.&nbsp; I like
singing; &rsquo;tis warming and cheering, and shall not be put
down.&nbsp; I should like to hear anybody say
otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Welcome, Master Derriman,&rsquo; said the miller,
filling a glass and handing it to the yeoman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come
all the way from quarters, then?&nbsp; I hardly knowed ye in your
soldier&rsquo;s clothes.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d look more natural with
a spud in your hand, sir.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; known
ye at all if I hadn&rsquo;t heard that you were called
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More natural with a spud!&mdash;have a care,
miller,&rsquo; said the young giant, the fire of his complexion
increasing to scarlet.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean anger,
but&mdash;but&mdash;a soldier&rsquo;s honour, you
know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The military in the background laughed a little, and the
yeoman then for the first time discovered that there were more
regulars present than one.&nbsp; He looked momentarily
disconcerted, but expanded again to full assurance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right, right, Master Derriman, no
offence&mdash;&rsquo;twas only my joke,&rsquo; said the genial
miller.&nbsp; &lsquo;Everybody&rsquo;s a soldier nowadays.&nbsp;
Drink a drap o&rsquo; this cordial, and don&rsquo;t mind
words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man drank without the least reluctance, and said,
&lsquo;Yes, miller, I am called out.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis ticklish
times for us soldiers now; we hold our lives in our
hands&mdash;What are those fellows grinning at behind the
table?&mdash;I say, we do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Staying with your uncle at the farm for a day or two,
Mr. Derriman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; as I told you, six mile off.&nbsp; Billeted at
Casterbridge.&nbsp; But I have to call and see the old,
old&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentleman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentleman!&mdash;no, skinflint.&nbsp; He lives upon the
sweepings of the barton; ha, ha!&rsquo;&nbsp; And the
speaker&rsquo;s regular white teeth showed themselves like snow
in a Dutch cabbage.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, well, the profession of
arms makes a man proof against all that.&nbsp; I take things as I
find &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite right, Master Derriman.&nbsp; Another
drop?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take no more than is good for
me&mdash;no man should; so don&rsquo;t tempt me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The yeoman then saw Anne, and by an unconscious gravitation
went towards her and the other women, flinging a remark to John
Loveday in passing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, Loveday!&nbsp; I heard you
were come; in short, I come o&rsquo; purpose to see you.&nbsp;
Glad to see you enjoying yourself at home again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The trumpet-major replied civilly, though not without
grimness, for he seemed hardly to like Derriman&rsquo;s motion
towards Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Widow Garland&rsquo;s daughter!&mdash;yes, &rsquo;tis!
surely.&nbsp; You remember me?&nbsp; I have been here
before.&nbsp; Festus Derriman, Yeomanry Cavalry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne gave a little curtsey.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know your name is
Festus&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, &rsquo;tis well known&mdash;especially
latterly.&rsquo;&nbsp; He dropped his voice to confidence
pitch.&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose your friends here are disturbed by
my coming in, as they don&rsquo;t seem to talk much?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mean to interrupt the party; but I often find that
people are put out by my coming among &rsquo;em, especially when
I&rsquo;ve got my regimentals on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;La! and are they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; &rsquo;tis the way I have.&rsquo;&nbsp; He further
lowered his tone, as if they had been old friends, though in
reality he had only seen her three or four times.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And how did you come to be here?&nbsp; Dash my wig, I
don&rsquo;t like to see a nice young lady like you in this
company.&nbsp; You should come to some of our yeomanry sprees in
Casterbridge or Shottsford-Forum.&nbsp; O, but the girls do
come!&nbsp; The yeomanry are respected men, men of good
substantial families, many farming their own land; and every one
among us rides his own charger, which is more than these cussed
fellows do.&rsquo;&nbsp; He nodded towards the dragoons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush!&nbsp; Why, these are friends and neighbours
of Miller Loveday, and he is a great friend of ours&mdash;our
best friend,&rsquo; said Anne with great emphasis, and reddening
at the sense of injustice to their host.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are
you thinking of, talking like that?&nbsp; It is ungenerous in
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, ha!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve affronted you.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t that it, fair angel, fair&mdash;what do you call
it?&mdash;fair vestal?&nbsp; Ah, well! would you was safe in my
own house!&nbsp; But honour must be minded now, not
courting.&nbsp; Rollicum-rorum, tol-lol-lorum.&nbsp; Pardon me,
my sweet, I like ye!&nbsp; It may be a come down for me, owning
land; but I do like ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, please be quiet,&rsquo; said Anne, distressed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, I will.&nbsp; Well, Corporal Tullidge,
how&rsquo;s your head?&rsquo; he said, going towards the other
end of the room, and leaving Anne to herself.</p>
<p>The company had again recovered its liveliness, and it was a
long time before the bouncing Rufus who had joined them could
find heart to tear himself away from their society and good
liquors, although he had had quite enough of the latter before he
entered.&nbsp; The natives received him at his own valuation, and
the soldiers of the camp, who sat beyond the table, smiled behind
their pipes at his remarks, with a pleasant twinkle of the eye
which approached the satirical, John Loveday being not the least
conspicuous in this bearing.&nbsp; But he and his friends were
too courteous on such an occasion as the present to challenge the
young man&rsquo;s large remarks, and readily permitted him to set
them right on the details of camping and other military routine,
about which the troopers seemed willing to let persons hold any
opinion whatever, provided that they themselves were not obliged
to give attention to it; showing, strangely enough, that if there
was one subject more than another which never interested their
minds, it was the art of war.&nbsp; To them the art of enjoying
good company in Overcombe Mill, the details of the miller&rsquo;s
household, the swarming of his bees, the number of his chickens,
and the fatness of his pigs, were matters of infinitely greater
concern.</p>
<p>The present writer, to whom this party has been described
times out of number by members of the Loveday family and other
aged people now passed away, can never enter the old living-room
of Overcombe Mill without beholding the genial scene through the
mists of the seventy or eighty years that intervene between then
and now.&nbsp; First and brightest to the eye are the dozen
candles, scattered about regardless of expense, and kept well
snuffed by the miller, who walks round the room at intervals of
five minutes, snuffers in hand, and nips each wick with great
precision, and with something of an executioner&rsquo;s grim look
upon his face as he closes the snuffers upon the neck of the
candle.&nbsp; Next to the candle-light show the red and blue
coats and white breeches of the soldiers&mdash;nearly twenty of
them in all besides the ponderous Derriman&mdash;the head of the
latter, and, indeed, the heads of all who are standing up, being
in dangerous proximity to the black beams of the ceiling.&nbsp;
There is not one among them who would attach any meaning to
&lsquo;Vittoria,&rsquo; or gather from the syllables
&lsquo;Waterloo&rsquo; the remotest idea of his own glory or
death.&nbsp; Next appears the correct and innocent Anne, little
thinking what things Time has in store for her at no great
distance off.&nbsp; She looks at Derriman with a half-uneasy
smile as he clanks hither and thither, and hopes he will not
single her out again to hold a private dialogue with&mdash;which,
however, he does, irresistibly attracted by the white muslin
figure.&nbsp; She must, of course, look a little gracious again
now, lest his mood should turn from sentimental to
quarrelsome&mdash;no impossible contingency with the
yeoman-soldier, as her quick perception had noted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well; this idling won&rsquo;t do for me,
folks,&rsquo; he at last said, to Anne&rsquo;s relief.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I ought not to have come in, by rights; but I heard you
enjoying yourselves, and thought it might be worth while to see
what you were up to; I have several miles to go before
bedtime;&rsquo; and stretching his arms, lifting his chin, and
shaking his head, to eradicate any unseemly curve or wrinkle from
his person, the yeoman wished them an off-hand good-night, and
departed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should have teased him a little more,
father,&rsquo; said the trumpet-major drily.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
could soon have made him as crabbed as a bear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to provoke the
chap&mdash;&rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t worth while.&nbsp; He came in
friendly enough,&rsquo; said the gentle miller without looking
up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think he was overmuch friendly,&rsquo;
said John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis as well to be neighbourly with folks, if
they be not quite onbearable,&rsquo; his father genially replied,
as he took off his coat to go and draw more ale&mdash;this
periodical stripping to the shirt-sleeves being necessitated by
the narrowness of the cellar and the smeary effect of its
numerous cobwebs upon best clothes.</p>
<p>Some of the guests then spoke of Fess Derriman as not such a
bad young man if you took him right and humoured him; others said
that he was nobody&rsquo;s enemy but his own; and the elder
ladies mentioned in a tone of interest that he was likely to come
into a deal of money at his uncle&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The person
who did not praise was the one who knew him best, who had known
him as a boy years ago, when he had lived nearer to Overcombe
than he did at present.&nbsp; This unappreciative person was the
trumpet-major.</p>
<h2>VI.&nbsp; OLD MR. DERRIMAN OF OXWELL HALL</h2>
<p>At this time in the history of Overcombe one solitary
newspaper occasionally found its way into the village.&nbsp; It
was lent by the postmaster at Budmouth (who, in some mysterious
way, got it for nothing through his connexion with the mail) to
Mr. Derriman at the Hall, by whom it was handed on to Mrs.
Garland when it was not more than a fortnight old.&nbsp; Whoever
remembers anything about the old farmer-squire will, of course,
know well enough that this delightful privilege of reading
history in long columns was not accorded to the Widow Garland for
nothing.&nbsp; It was by such ingenuous means that he paid her
for her daughter&rsquo;s occasional services in reading aloud to
him and making out his accounts, in which matters the farmer,
whose guineas were reported to touch five figures&mdash;some said
more&mdash;was not expert.</p>
<p>Mrs. Martha Garland, as a respectable widow, occupied a
twilight rank between the benighted villagers and the
well-informed gentry, and kindly made herself useful to the
former as letter-writer and reader, and general translator from
the printing tongue.&nbsp; It was not without satisfaction that
she stood at her door of an evening, newspaper in hand, with
three or four cottagers standing round, and poured down their
open throats any paragraph that she might choose to select from
the stirring ones of the period.&nbsp; When she had done with the
sheet Mrs. Garland passed it on to the miller, the miller to the
grinder, and the grinder to the grinder&rsquo;s boy, in whose
hands it became subdivided into half pages, quarter pages, and
irregular triangles, and ended its career as a paper cap, a
flagon bung, or a wrapper for his bread and cheese.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his compact with Mrs. Garland, old Mr.
Derriman kept the paper so long, and was so chary of wasting his
man&rsquo;s time on a merely intellectual errand, that unless she
sent for the journal it seldom reached her hands.&nbsp; Anne was
always her messenger.&nbsp; The arrival of the soldiers led Mrs.
Garland to despatch her daughter for it the day after the party;
and away she went in her hat and pelisse, in a direction at right
angles to that of the encampment on the hill.</p>
<p>Walking across the fields for the distance of a mile or two,
she came out upon the high-road by a wicket-gate.&nbsp; On the
other side of the way was the entrance to what at first sight
looked like a neglected meadow, the gate being a rotten one,
without a bottom rail, and broken-down palings lying on each
side.&nbsp; The dry hard mud of the opening was marked with
several horse and cow tracks, that had been half obliterated by
fifty score sheep tracks, surcharged with the tracks of a man and
a dog.&nbsp; Beyond this geological record appeared a
carriage-road, nearly grown over with grass, which Anne
followed.&nbsp; It descended by a gentle slope, dived under
dark-rinded elm and chestnut trees, and conducted her on till the
hiss of a waterfall and the sound of the sea became audible, when
it took a bend round a swamp of fresh watercress and brooklime
that had once been a fish pond.&nbsp; Here the grey, weather-worn
front of a building edged from behind the trees.&nbsp; It was
Oxwell Hall, once the seat of a family now extinct, and of late
years used as a farmhouse.</p>
<p>Benjamin Derriman, who owned the crumbling place, had
originally been only the occupier and tenant-farmer of the fields
around.&nbsp; His wife had brought him a small fortune, and
during the growth of their only son there had been a partition of
the Oxwell estate, giving the farmer, now a widower, the
opportunity of acquiring the building and a small portion of the
land attached on exceptionally low terms.&nbsp; But two years
after the purchase the boy died, and Derriman&rsquo;s existence
was paralyzed forthwith.&nbsp; It was said that since that event
he had devised the house and fields to a distant female relative,
to keep them out of the hands of his detested nephew; but this
was not certainly known.</p>
<p>The hall was as interesting as mansions in a state of
declension usually are, as the excellent county history
showed.&nbsp; That popular work in folio contained an old plate
dedicated to the last scion of the original owners, from which
drawing it appeared that in 1750, the date of publication, the
windows were covered with little scratches like black flashes of
lightning; that a horn of hard smoke came out of each of the
twelve chimneys; that a lady and a lap-dog stood on the lawn in a
strenuously walking position; and a substantial cloud and nine
flying birds of no known species hung over the trees to the
north-east.</p>
<p>The rambling and neglected dwelling had all the romantic
excellencies and practical drawbacks which such mildewed places
share in common with caves, mountains, wildernesses, glens, and
other homes of poesy that people of taste wish to live and die
in.&nbsp; Mustard and cress could have been raised on the inner
plaster of the dewy walls at any height not exceeding three feet
from the floor; and mushrooms of the most refined and
thin-stemmed kinds grew up through the chinks of the larder
paving.&nbsp; As for the outside, Nature, in the ample time that
had been given her, had so mingled her filings and effacements
with the marks of human wear and tear upon the house, that it was
often hard to say in which of the two or if in both, any
particular obliteration had its origin.&nbsp; The keenness was
gone from the mouldings of the doorways, but whether worn out by
the rubbing past of innumerable people&rsquo;s shoulders, and the
moving of their heavy furniture, or by Time in a grander and more
abstract form, did not appear.&nbsp; The iron stanchions inside
the window-panes were eaten away to the size of wires at the
bottom where they entered the stone, the condensed breathings of
generations having settled there in pools and rusted them.&nbsp;
The panes themselves had either lost their shine altogether or
become iridescent as a peacock&rsquo;s tail.&nbsp; In the middle
of the porch was a vertical sun-dial, whose gnomon swayed loosely
about when the wind blew, and cast its shadow hither and thither,
as much as to say, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your fine model dial;
here&rsquo;s any time for any man; I am an old dial; and
shiftiness is the best policy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne passed under the arched gateway which screened the main
front; over it was the porter&rsquo;s lodge, reached by a spiral
staircase.&nbsp; Across the archway was fixed a row of wooden
hurdles, one of which Anne opened and closed behind her.&nbsp;
Their necessity was apparent as soon as she got inside.&nbsp; The
quadrangle of the ancient pile was a bed of mud and manure,
inhabited by calves, geese, ducks, and sow pigs surprisingly
large, with young ones surprisingly small.&nbsp; In the groined
porch some heifers were amusing themselves by stretching up their
necks and licking the carved stone capitals that supported the
vaulting.&nbsp; Anne went on to a second and open door, across
which was another hurdle to keep the live stock from absolute
community with the inmates.&nbsp; There being no knocker, she
knocked by means of a short stick which was laid against the post
for that purpose; but nobody attending, she entered the passage,
and tried an inner door.</p>
<p>A slight noise was heard inside, the door opened about an
inch, and a strip of decayed face, including the eye and some
forehead wrinkles, appeared within the crevice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please I have come for the paper,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, is it you, dear Anne?&rsquo; whined the inmate,
opening the door a little further.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could hardly
get to the door to open it, I am so weak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was a wizened old gentleman, in a coat the colour
of his farmyard, breeches of the same hue, unbuttoned at the
knees, revealing a bit of leg above his stocking and a dazzlingly
white shirt-frill to compensate for this untidiness below.&nbsp;
The edge of his skull round his eye-sockets was visible through
the skin, and he had a mouth whose corners made towards the back
of his head on the slightest provocation.&nbsp; He walked with
great apparent difficulty back into the room, Anne following
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you can have the paper if you want it; but you
never give me much time to see what&rsquo;s in en!&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s the paper.&rsquo;&nbsp; He held it out, but before
she could take it he drew it back again, saying, &lsquo;I have
not had my share o&rsquo; the paper by a good deal, what with my
weak sight, and people coming so soon for en.&nbsp; I am a poor
put-upon soul; but my &ldquo;Duty of Man&rdquo; will be left to
me when the newspaper is gone.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he sank into his
chair with an air of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Anne said that she did not wish to take the paper if he had
not done with it, and that she was really later in the week than
usual, owing to the soldiers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Soldiers, yes&mdash;rot the soldiers!&nbsp; And now
hedges will be broke, and hens&rsquo; nests robbed, and
sucking-pigs stole, and I don&rsquo;t know what all.&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;s to pay for&rsquo;t, sure?&nbsp; I reckon that because
the soldiers be come you don&rsquo;t mean to be kind enough to
read to me what I hadn&rsquo;t time to read myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She would read if he wished, she said; she was in no
hurry.&nbsp; And sitting herself down she unfolded the paper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Dinner at Carlton House&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, faith.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis nothing to I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Defence of the country&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye may read that if ye will.&nbsp; I hope there will be
no billeting in this parish, or any wild work of that sort; for
what would a poor old lamiger like myself do with soldiers in his
house, and nothing to feed &rsquo;em with?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne began reading, and continued at her task nearly ten
minutes, when she was interrupted by the appearance in the
quadrangular slough without of a large figure in the uniform of
the yeomanry cavalry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you see out there?&rsquo; said the farmer with
a start, as she paused and slowly blushed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A soldier&mdash;one of the yeomanry,&rsquo; said Anne,
not quite at her ease.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scrounch it all&mdash;&rsquo;tis my nephew!&rsquo;
exclaimed the old man, his face turning to a phosphoric pallor,
and his body twitching with innumerable alarms as he formed upon
his face a gasping smile of joy, with which to welcome the
new-coming relative.&nbsp; &lsquo;Read on, prithee, Miss
Garland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before she had read far the visitor straddled over the
door-hurdle into the passage and entered the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, nunc, how do you feel?&rsquo; said the giant,
shaking hands with the farmer in the manner of one violently
ringing a hand-bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Glad to see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bad and weakish, Festus,&rsquo; replied the other, his
person responding passively to the rapid vibrations
imparted.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, be tender, please&mdash;a little
softer, there&rsquo;s a dear nephew!&nbsp; My arm is no more than
a cobweb.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, poor soul!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am not much more than a skeleton, and
can&rsquo;t bear rough usage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sorry to hear that; but I&rsquo;ll bear your affliction
in mind.&nbsp; Why, you are all in a tremble, Uncle
Benjy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis because I am so gratified,&rsquo; said the
old man.&nbsp; &lsquo;I always get all in a tremble when I am
taken by surprise by a beloved relation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s it!&rsquo; said the yeoman, bringing
his hand down on the back of his uncle&rsquo;s chair with a loud
smack, at which Uncle Benjy nervously sprang three inches from
his seat and dropped into it again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ask your pardon
for frightening ye, uncle.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis how we do in the
army, and I forgot your nerves.&nbsp; You have scarcely expected
to see me, I dare say, but here I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to see ye.&nbsp; You are not going to stay
long, perhaps?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite the contrary.&nbsp; I am going to stay ever so
long!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O I see!&nbsp; I am so glad, dear Festus.&nbsp; Ever so
long, did ye say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, <i>ever</i> so long,&rsquo; said the young
gentleman, sitting on the slope of the bureau and stretching out
his legs as props.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am going to make this quite my
own home whenever I am off duty, as long as we stay out.&nbsp;
And after that, when the campaign is over in the autumn, I shall
come here, and live with you like your own son, and help manage
your land and your farm, you know, and make you a comfortable old
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; How you do please me!&rsquo; said the farmer,
with a horrified smile, and grasping the arms of his chair to
sustain himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I have been meaning to come a long time, as I knew
you&rsquo;d like to have me, Uncle Benjy; and &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t
in my heart to refuse you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You always was kind that way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I always was.&nbsp; But I ought to tell you at
once, not to disappoint you, that I shan&rsquo;t be here
always&mdash;all day, that is, because of my military duties as a
cavalry man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, not always?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a pity!&rsquo;
exclaimed the farmer with a cheerful eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew you&rsquo;d say so.&nbsp; And I shan&rsquo;t be
able to sleep here at night sometimes, for the same
reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not sleep here o&rsquo; nights?&rsquo; said the old
gentleman, still more relieved.&nbsp; &lsquo;You ought to sleep
here&mdash;you certainly ought; in short, you must.&nbsp; But you
can&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not while we are with the colours.&nbsp; But directly
that&rsquo;s over&mdash;the very next day&mdash;I&rsquo;ll stay
here all day, and all night too, to oblige you, since you ask me
so very kindly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Th-thank ye, that will be very nice!&rsquo; said Uncle
Benjy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I knew &rsquo;twould relieve ye.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
he kindly stroked his uncle&rsquo;s head, the old man expressing
his enjoyment at the affectionate token by a death&rsquo;s-head
grimace.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should have called to see you the other
night when I passed through here,&rsquo; Festus continued;
&lsquo;but it was so late that I couldn&rsquo;t come so far out
of my way.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t think it unkind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all, if you <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>.&nbsp; I never
shall think it unkind if you really <i>can&rsquo;t</i> come, you
know, Festy.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was a few minutes&rsquo; pause,
and as the nephew said nothing Uncle Benjy went on: &lsquo;I wish
I had a little present for ye.&nbsp; But as ill-luck would have
it we have lost a deal of stock this year, and I have had to pay
away so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor old man&mdash;I know you have.&nbsp; Shall I lend
you a seven-shilling piece, Uncle Benjy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, ha!&mdash;you must have your joke; well, I&rsquo;ll
think o&rsquo; that.&nbsp; And so they expect Buonaparty to
choose this very part of the coast for his landing, hey?&nbsp;
And that the yeomanry be to stand in front as the forlorn
hope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who says so?&rsquo; asked the florid son of Mars,
losing a little redness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The newspaper-man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, there&rsquo;s nothing in that,&rsquo; said Festus
bravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;The gover&rsquo;ment thought it possible at
one time; but they don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Festus turned himself as he talked, and now said abruptly:
&lsquo;Ah, who&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;tis our little
Anne!&rsquo;&nbsp; He had not noticed her till this moment, the
young woman having at his entry kept her face over the newspaper,
and then got away to the back part of the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
are you and your mother always going to stay down there in the
mill-house watching the little fishes, Miss Anne?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said that it was uncertain, in a tone of truthful
precision which the question was hardly worth, looking forcedly
at him as she spoke.&nbsp; But she blushed fitfully, in her arms
and hands as much as in her face.&nbsp; Not that she was
overpowered by the great boots, formidable spurs, and other
fierce appliances of his person, as he imagined; simply she had
not been prepared to meet him there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you will, I am sure, for my own good,&rsquo;
said he, letting his eyes linger on the round of her cheek.</p>
<p>Anne became a little more dignified, and her look showed
reserve.&nbsp; But the yeoman on perceiving this went on talking
to her in so civil a way that he irresistibly amused her, though
she tried to conceal all feeling.&nbsp; At a brighter remark of
his than usual her mouth moved, her upper lip playing uncertainly
over her white teeth; it would stay still&mdash;no, it would
withdraw a little way in a smile; then it would flutter down
again; and so it wavered like a butterfly in a tender desire to
be pleased and smiling, and yet to be also sedate and composed;
to show him that she did not want compliments, and yet that she
was not so cold as to wish to repress any genuine feeling he
might be anxious to utter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall you want any more reading, Mr. Derriman?&rsquo;
said she, interrupting the younger man in his remarks.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If not, I&rsquo;ll go homeward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let me hinder you longer,&rsquo; said
Festus.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m off in a minute or two, when your
man has cleaned my boots.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye don&rsquo;t hinder us, nephew.&nbsp; She must have
the paper: &rsquo;tis the day for her to have &rsquo;n.&nbsp; She
might read a little more, as I have had so little profit out
o&rsquo; en hitherto.&nbsp; Well, why don&rsquo;t ye speak?&nbsp;
Will ye, or won&rsquo;t ye, my dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to two,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho, ho! damn it, I must go then, I suppose,&rsquo; said
Festus, laughing; and unable to get a further glance from her he
left the room and clanked into the back yard, where he saw a man;
holding up his hand he cried, &lsquo;Anthony
Cripplestraw!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cripplestraw came up in a trot, moved a lock of his hair and
replaced it, and said, &lsquo;Yes, Maister Derriman.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He was old Mr. Derriman&rsquo;s odd hand in the yard and garden,
and like his employer had no great pretensions to manly beauty,
owing to a limpness of backbone and speciality of mouth, which
opened on one side only, giving him a triangular smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Cripplestraw, how is it to-day?&rsquo; said
Festus, with socially-superior heartiness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Middlin&rsquo;, considering, Maister Derriman.&nbsp;
And how&rsquo;s yerself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fairish.&nbsp; Well, now, see and clean these military
boots of mine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll cock my foot up on this
bench.&nbsp; This pigsty of my uncle&rsquo;s is not fit for a
soldier to come into.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Maister Derriman, I will.&nbsp; No, &rsquo;tis not
fit, Maister Derriman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What stock has uncle lost this year,
Cripplestraw?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see, sir.&nbsp; I can call to mind
that we&rsquo;ve lost three chickens, a tom-pigeon, and a weakly
sucking-pig, one of a fare of ten.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think of
no more, Maister Derriman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m, not a large quantity of cattle.&nbsp; The
old rascal!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, &rsquo;tis not a large quantity.&nbsp; Old what did
you say, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O nothing.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s within there.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Festus flung his forehead in the direction of a right line
towards the inner apartment.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a regular
sniche one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hee, hee; fie, fie, Master Derriman!&rsquo; said
Cripplestraw, shaking his head in delighted censure.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Gentlefolks shouldn&rsquo;t talk so.&nbsp; And an officer,
Mr. Derriman!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the duty of all cavalry gentlemen
to bear in mind that their blood is a knowed thing in the
country, and not to speak ill o&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s close-fisted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, maister, he is&mdash;I own he is a little.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis the nater of some old venerable gentlemen to be
so.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll hope he&rsquo;ll treat ye well in yer
fortune, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hope he will.&nbsp; Do people talk about me here,
Cripplestraw?&rsquo; asked the yeoman, as the other continued
busy with his boots.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes, sir; they do off and on, you know.&nbsp;
They says you be as fine a piece of calvery flesh and bones as
was ever growed on fallow-ground; in short, all owns that you be
a fine fellow, sir.&nbsp; I wish I wasn&rsquo;t no more afraid of
the French than you be; but being in the Locals, Maister
Derriman, I assure ye I dream of having to defend my country
every night; and I don&rsquo;t like the dream at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should take it careless, Cripplestraw, as I do; and
&rsquo;twould soon come natural to you not to mind it at
all.&nbsp; Well, a fine fellow is not everything, you know.&nbsp;
O no.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s as good as I in the army, and even
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And they say that when you fall this summer,
you&rsquo;ll die like a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I fall?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sure, Maister Derriman.&nbsp; Poor soul o&rsquo;
thee!&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t forget &rsquo;ee as you lie mouldering
in yer soldier&rsquo;s grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey?&rsquo; said the warrior uneasily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What makes &rsquo;em think I am going to fall?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, by all accounts the yeomanry will be put in
front.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Front!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what my uncle has been
saying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and by all accounts &rsquo;tis true.&nbsp; And
naterelly they&rsquo;ll be mowed down like grass; and you among
&rsquo;em, poor young galliant officer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, Cripplestraw.&nbsp; This is a reg&rsquo;lar
foolish report.&nbsp; How can yeomanry be put in front?&nbsp;
Nobody&rsquo;s put in front.&nbsp; We yeomanry have nothing to do
with Buonaparte&rsquo;s landing.&nbsp; We shall be away in a safe
place, guarding the possessions and jewels.&nbsp; Now, can you
see, Cripplestraw, any way at all that the yeomanry can be put in
front?&nbsp; Do you think they really can?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, maister, I am afraid I do,&rsquo; said the
cheering Cripplestraw.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I know a great warrior
like you is only too glad o&rsquo; the chance.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill
be a great thing for ye, death and glory!&nbsp; In short, I hope
from my heart you will be, and I say so very often to
folk&mdash;in fact, I pray at night for&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O! cuss you! you needn&rsquo;t pray about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Maister Derriman, I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course my sword will do its duty.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
enough.&nbsp; And now be off with ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Festus gloomily returned to his uncle&rsquo;s room and found
that Anne was just leaving.&nbsp; He was inclined to follow her
at once, but as she gave him no opportunity for doing this he
went to the window, and remained tapping his fingers against the
shutter while she crossed the yard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, nephy, you are not gone yet?&rsquo; said the
farmer, looking dubiously at Festus from under one eyelid.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You see how I am.&nbsp; Not by any means better, you see;
so I can&rsquo;t entertain &rsquo;ee as well as I
would.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t, nunc, you can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think you are worse&mdash;if I do, dash my wig.&nbsp;
But you&rsquo;ll have plenty of opportunities to make me welcome
when you are better.&nbsp; If you are not so brisk inwardly as
you was, why not try change of air?&nbsp; This is a dull, damp
hole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis, Festus; and I am thinking of
moving.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, where to?&rsquo; said Festus, with surprise and
interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Up into the garret in the north corner.&nbsp; There is
no fireplace in the room; but I shan&rsquo;t want that, poor soul
o&rsquo; me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not moving far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not.&nbsp; But I have not a soul belonging
to me within ten mile; and you know very well that I
couldn&rsquo;t afford to go to lodgings that I had to pay
for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know it&mdash;I know it, Uncle Benjy!&nbsp; Well,
don&rsquo;t be disturbed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come and manage for
you as soon as ever this Boney alarm is over; but when a
man&rsquo;s country calls he must obey, if he is a
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A splendid spirit!&rsquo; said Uncle Benjy, with much
admiration on the surface of his countenance.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
never had it.&nbsp; How could it have got into the
boy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From my mother&rsquo;s side, perhaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps so.&nbsp; Well, take care of yourself,
nephy,&rsquo; said the farmer, waving his hand
impressively.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take care!&nbsp; In these warlike
times your spirit may carry ye into the arms of the enemy; and
you are the last of the family.&nbsp; You should think of this,
and not let your bravery carry ye away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be disturbed, uncle; I&rsquo;ll control
myself,&rsquo; said Festus, betrayed into self-complacency
against his will.&nbsp; &lsquo;At least I&rsquo;ll do what I can,
but nature will out sometimes.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m
off.&rsquo;&nbsp; He began humming &lsquo;Brighton Camp,&rsquo;
and, promising to come again soon, retired with assurance, each
yard of his retreat adding private joyousness to his
uncle&rsquo;s form.</p>
<p>When the bulky young man had disappeared through the
porter&rsquo;s lodge, Uncle Benjy showed preternatural activity
for one in his invalid state, jumping up quickly without his
stick, at the same time opening and shutting his mouth quite
silently like a thirsty frog, which was his way of expressing
mirth.&nbsp; He ran upstairs as quick as an old squirrel, and
went to a dormer window which commanded a view of the grounds
beyond the gate, and the footpath that stretched across them to
the village.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; he said in a suppressed scream,
dancing up and down, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s after her: she&rsquo;ve
hit en!&rsquo;&nbsp; For there appeared upon the path the figure
of Anne Garland, and, hastening on at some little distance behind
her, the swaggering shape of Festus.&nbsp; She became conscious
of his approach, and moved more quickly.&nbsp; He moved more
quickly still, and overtook her.&nbsp; She turned as if in answer
to a call from him, and he walked on beside her, till they were
out of sight.&nbsp; The old man then played upon an imaginary
fiddle for about half a minute; and, suddenly discontinuing these
signs of pleasure, went downstairs again.</p>
<h2>VII.&nbsp; HOW THEY TALKED IN THE PASTURES</h2>
<p>&lsquo;You often come this way?&rsquo; said Festus to Anne
rather before he had overtaken her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I come for the newspaper and other things,&rsquo; she
said, perplexed by a doubt whether he were there by accident or
design.</p>
<p>They moved on in silence, Festus beating the grass with his
switch in a masterful way.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you speak,
Mis&rsquo;ess Anne?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ten thousand pardons.&nbsp; I thought you did.&nbsp;
Now don&rsquo;t let me drive you out of the path.&nbsp; I can
walk among the high grass and giltycups&mdash;they will not
yellow my stockings as they will yours.&nbsp; Well, what do you
think of a lot of soldiers coming to the neighbourhood in this
way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it is very lively, and a great change,&rsquo;
she said with demure seriousness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t like us warriors as a
body?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne smiled without replying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you are laughing!&rsquo; said the yeoman, looking
searchingly at her and blushing like a little fire.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What do you see to laugh at?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I laugh?&rsquo; said Anne, a little scared at his
sudden mortification.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, yes; you know you did, you young sneerer,&rsquo;
he said like a cross baby.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are laughing at
me&mdash;that&rsquo;s who you are laughing at!&nbsp; I should
like to know what you would do without such as me if the French
were to drop in upon ye any night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you help to beat them off?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you ask such a question?&nbsp; What are we
for?&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t think anything of
soldiers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>O yes, she liked soldiers, she said, especially when they came
home from the wars, covered with glory; though when she thought
what doings had won them that glory she did not like them quite
so well.&nbsp; The gallant and appeased yeoman said he supposed
her to mean chopping off heads, blowing out brains, and that kind
of business, and thought it quite right that a tender-hearted
thing like her should feel a little horrified.&nbsp; But as for
him, he should not mind such another Blenheim this summer as the
army had fought a hundred years ago, or whenever it
was&mdash;dash his wig if he should mind it at all.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hullo! now you are laughing again; yes, I saw
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; And the choleric Festus turned his blue eyes
and flushed face upon her as though he would read her
through.&nbsp; Anne strove valiantly to look calmly back; but her
eyes could not face his, and they fell.&nbsp; &lsquo;You did
laugh!&rsquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was only a tiny little one,&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;I knew you did!&rsquo; thundered he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now what was it you laughed at?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only&mdash;thought that you were&mdash;merely in the
yeomanry,&rsquo; she murmured slily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what of that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the yeomanry only seem farmers that have lost their
senses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes!&nbsp; I knew you meant some jeering o&rsquo;
that sort, Mistress Anne.&nbsp; But I suppose &rsquo;tis the way
of women, and I take no notice.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll confess that
some of us are no great things: but I know how to draw a sword,
don&rsquo;t I?&mdash;say I don&rsquo;t just to provoke
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure you do,&rsquo; said Anne sweetly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If a Frenchman came up to you, Mr. Derriman, would you
take him on the hip, or on the thigh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you are flattering!&rsquo; he said, his white teeth
uncovering themselves in a smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, of course I
should draw my sword&mdash;no, I mean my sword would be already
drawn; and I should put spurs to my horse&mdash;charger, as we
call it in the army; and I should ride up to him and
say&mdash;no, I shouldn&rsquo;t say anything, of course&mdash;men
never waste words in battle; I should take him with the third
guard, low point, and then coming back to the second
guard&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But that would be taking care of yourself&mdash;not
hitting at him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you say that!&rsquo; he cried, the beams upon
his face turning to a lurid cloud in a moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
can you understand military terms who&rsquo;ve never had a sword
in your life?&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t take him with the sword at
all.&rsquo;&nbsp; He went on with eager sulkiness, &lsquo;I
should take him with my pistol.&nbsp; I should pull off my right
glove, and throw back my goat-skin; then I should open my
priming-pan, prime, and cast about&mdash;no, I shouldn&rsquo;t,
that&rsquo;s wrong; I should draw my right pistol, and as soon as
loaded, seize the weapon by the butt; then at the word
&ldquo;Cock your pistol&rdquo; I should&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then there is plenty of time to give such words of
command in the heat of battle?&rsquo; said Anne innocently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; said the yeoman, his face again in
flames.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, of course I am only telling you what
<i>would</i> be the word of command <i>if</i>&mdash;there now!
you la&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t; &rsquo;pon my word I
didn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think you did; it was my
mistake.&nbsp; Well, then I come smartly to Present, looking well
along the barrel&mdash;along the barrel&mdash;and fire.&nbsp; Of
course I know well enough how to engage the enemy!&nbsp; But I
expect my old uncle has been setting you against me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has not said a word,&rsquo; replied Anne;
&lsquo;though I have heard of you, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you heard?&nbsp; Nothing good, I dare
say.&nbsp; It makes my blood boil within me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, nothing bad,&rsquo; said she assuringly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Just a word now and then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, come, tell me, there&rsquo;s a dear.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like to be crossed.&nbsp; It shall be a sacred secret
between us.&nbsp; Come, now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne was embarrassed, and her smile was uncomfortable.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I shall not tell you,&rsquo; she said at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There it is again!&rsquo; said the yeoman, throwing
himself into a despair.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall soon begin to
believe that my name is not worth sixpence about here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you &rsquo;twas nothing against you,&rsquo;
repeated Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That means it might have been for me,&rsquo; said
Festus, in a mollified tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, though, to speak
the truth, I have a good many faults, some people will praise me,
I suppose.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas praise?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am not much at farming, and I am not much in
company, and I am not much at figures, but perhaps I must own,
since it is forced upon me, that I can show as fine a
soldier&rsquo;s figure on the Esplanade as any man of the
cavalry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can,&rsquo; said Anne; for though her flesh crept
in mortal terror of his irascibility, she could not resist the
fearful pleasure of leading him on.&nbsp; &lsquo;You look very
well; and some say, you are&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&nbsp; Well, they say I am good-looking.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t make myself, so &rsquo;tis no praise.&nbsp; Hullo!
what are you looking across there for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only at a bird that I saw fly out of that tree,&rsquo;
said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&nbsp; Only at a bird, do you say?&rsquo; he
heaved out in a voice of thunder.&nbsp; &lsquo;I see your
shoulders a-shaking, young madam.&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t you
provoke me with that laughing!&nbsp; By God, it won&rsquo;t
do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then go away!&rsquo; said Anne, changed from
mirthfulness to irritation by his rough manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t want your company, you great bragging thing!&nbsp;
You are so touchy there&rsquo;s no bearing with you.&nbsp; Go
away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Anne; I am wrong to speak to you so.&nbsp; I
give you free liberty to say what you will to me.&nbsp; Say I am
not a bit of a soldier, or anything!&nbsp; Abuse me&mdash;do now,
there&rsquo;s a dear.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m scum, I&rsquo;m froth,
I&rsquo;m dirt before the besom&mdash;yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have nothing to say, sir.&nbsp; Stay where you are
till I am out of this field.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;s such command in your looks that I
ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t heart to go against you.&nbsp; You will come
this way to-morrow at the same time?&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t be
uncivil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was too generous not to forgive him, but the short little
lip murmured that she did not think it at all likely she should
come that way to-morrow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Sunday?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Sunday,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Monday&mdash;Tuesday&mdash;Wednesday,
surely?&rsquo; he went on experimentally.</p>
<p>She answered that she should probably not see him on either
day, and, cutting short the argument, went through the wicket
into the other field.&nbsp; Festus paused, looking after her; and
when he could no longer see her slight figure he swept away his
deliberations, began singing, and turned off in the other
direction.</p>
<h2>VIII.&nbsp; ANNE MAKES A CIRCUIT OF THE CAMP</h2>
<p>When Anne was crossing the last field, she saw approaching her
an old woman with wrinkled cheeks, who surveyed the earth and its
inhabitants through the medium of brass-rimmed spectacles.&nbsp;
Shaking her head at Anne till the glasses shone like two moons,
she said, &lsquo;Ah, ah; I zeed ye!&nbsp; If I had only kept on
my short ones that I use for reading the Collect and Gospel I
shouldn&rsquo;t have zeed ye; but thinks I, I be going out
o&rsquo; doors, and I&rsquo;ll put on my long ones, little
thinking what they&rsquo;d show me.&nbsp; Ay, I can tell folk at
any distance with these&mdash;&rsquo;tis a beautiful pair for out
o&rsquo; doors; though my short ones be best for close work, such
as darning, and catching fleas, that&rsquo;s true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you seen, Granny Seamore?&rsquo; said
Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fie, fie, Miss Nancy! you know,&rsquo; said Granny
Seamore, shaking her head still.&nbsp; &lsquo;But he&rsquo;s a
fine young feller, and will have all his uncle&rsquo;s money when
&lsquo;a&rsquo;s gone.&rsquo;&nbsp; Anne said nothing to this,
and looking ahead with a smile passed Granny Seamore by.</p>
<p>Festus, the subject of the remark, was at this time about
three-and-twenty, a fine fellow as to feet and inches, and of a
remarkably warm tone in skin and hair.&nbsp; Symptoms of beard
and whiskers had appeared upon him at a very early age, owing to
his persistent use of the razor before there was any necessity
for its operation.&nbsp; The brave boy had scraped unseen in the
out-house, in the cellar, in the wood-shed, in the stable, in the
unused parlour, in the cow-stalls, in the barn, and wherever he
could set up his triangular bit of looking-glass without
observation, or extemporize a mirror by sticking up his hat on
the outside of a window-pane.&nbsp; The result now was that, did
he neglect to use the instrument he once had trifled with, a fine
rust broke out upon his countenance on the first day, a golden
lichen on the second, and a fiery stubble on the third to a
degree which admitted of no further postponement.</p>
<p>His disposition divided naturally into two, the boastful and
the cantankerous.&nbsp; When Festus put on the big pot, as it is
classically called, he was quite blinded ipso facto to the
diverting effect of that mood and manner upon others; but when
disposed to be envious or quarrelsome he was rather shrewd than
otherwise, and could do some pretty strokes of satire.&nbsp; He
was both liked and abused by the girls who knew him, and though
they were pleased by his attentions, they never failed to
ridicule him behind his back.&nbsp; In his cups (he knew those
vessels, though only twenty-three) he first became noisy, then
excessively friendly, and then invariably nagging.&nbsp; During
childhood he had made himself renowned for his pleasant habit of
pouncing down upon boys smaller and poorer than himself, and
knocking their birds&rsquo; nests out of their hands, or
overturning their little carts of apples, or pouring water down
their backs; but his conduct became singularly the reverse of
aggressive the moment the little boys&rsquo; mothers ran out to
him, brandishing brooms, frying-pans, skimmers, and whatever else
they could lay hands on by way of weapons.&nbsp; He then fled and
hid behind bushes, under faggots, or in pits till they had gone
away; and on one such occasion was known to creep into a
badger&rsquo;s hole quite out of sight, maintaining that post
with great firmness and resolution for two or three hours.&nbsp;
He had brought more vulgar exclamations upon the tongues of
respectable parents in his native parish than any other boy of
his time.&nbsp; When other youngsters snowballed him he ran into
a place of shelter, where he kneaded snowballs of his own, with a
stone inside, and used these formidable missiles in returning
their pleasantry.&nbsp; Sometimes he got fearfully beaten by boys
his own age, when he would roar most lustily, but fight on in the
midst of his tears, blood, and cries.</p>
<p>He was early in love, and had at the time of the story
suffered from the ravages of that passion thirteen distinct
times.&nbsp; He could not love lightly and gaily; his love was
earnest, cross-tempered, and even savage.&nbsp; It was a positive
agony to him to be ridiculed by the object of his affections, and
such conduct drove him into a frenzy if persisted in.&nbsp; He
was a torment to those who behaved humbly towards him, cynical
with those who denied his superiority, and a very nice fellow
towards those who had the courage to ill-use him.</p>
<p>This stalwart gentleman and Anne Garland did not cross each
other&rsquo;s paths again for a week.&nbsp; Then her mother began
as before about the newspaper, and, though Anne did not much like
the errand, she agreed to go for it on Mrs. Garland pressing her
with unusual anxiety.&nbsp; Why her mother was so persistent on
so small a matter quite puzzled the girl; but she put on her hat
and started.</p>
<p>As she had expected, Festus appeared at a stile over which she
sometimes went for shortness&rsquo; sake, and showed by his
manner that he awaited her.&nbsp; When she saw this she kept
straight on, as if she would not enter the park at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely this is your way?&rsquo; said Festus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was thinking of going round by the road,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why is that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She paused, as if she were not inclined to say.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
go that way when the grass is wet,&rsquo; she returned at
last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not wet now,&rsquo; he persisted; &lsquo;the sun
has been shining on it these nine hours.&rsquo;&nbsp; The fact
was that the way by the path was less open than by the road, and
Festus wished to walk with her uninterrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,
of course, it is nothing to me what you do.&rsquo;&nbsp; He flung
himself from the stile and walked away towards the house.</p>
<p>Anne, supposing him really indifferent, took the same way,
upon which he turned his head and waited for her with a proud
smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot go with you,&rsquo; she said decisively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, you foolish girl!&nbsp; I must walk along
with you down to the corner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, please, Mr. Derriman; we might be seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, now&mdash;that&rsquo;s shyness!&rsquo; he said
jocosely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; you know I cannot let you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I must.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I do not allow it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Allow it or not, I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are unkind, and I must submit,&rsquo; she
said, her eyes brimming with tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho, ho; what a shame of me!&nbsp; My wig, I won&rsquo;t
do any such thing for the world,&rsquo; said the repentant
yeoman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Haw, haw; why, I thought your &ldquo;go
away&rdquo; meant &ldquo;come on,&rdquo; as it does with so many
of the women I meet, especially in these clothes.&nbsp; Who was
to know you were so confoundedly serious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he did not go Anne stood still and said nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see you have a deal more caution and a deal less
good-nature than I ever thought you had,&rsquo; he continued
emphatically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir; it is not any planned manner of mine at
all,&rsquo; she said earnestly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you will see, I
am sure, that I could not go down to the hall with you without
putting myself in a wrong light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; I am only
a fellow in the yeomanry cavalry&mdash;a plain soldier, I may
say; and we know what women think of such: that they are a bad
lot&mdash;men you mustn&rsquo;t speak to for fear of losing your
character&mdash;chaps you avoid in the roads&mdash;chaps that
come into a house like oxen, daub the stairs wi&rsquo; their
boots, stain the furniture wi&rsquo; their drink, talk rubbish to
the servants, abuse all that&rsquo;s holy and righteous, and are
only saved from being carried off by Old Nick because they are
wanted for Boney.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I didn&rsquo;t know you were thought so bad of
as that,&rsquo; said she simply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! don&rsquo;t my uncle complain to you of me?&nbsp;
You are a favourite of that handsome, nice old gaffer&rsquo;s, I
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what do we think of our nice trumpet-major,
hey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne closed her mouth up tight, built it up, in fact, to show
that no answer was coming to that question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O now, come, seriously, Loveday is a good fellow, and
so is his father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a close little rogue you are!&nbsp; There is no
getting anything out of you.&nbsp; I believe you would say
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; to every mortal question, so
very discreet as you are.&nbsp; Upon my heart, there are some
women who would say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; to
&ldquo;Will ye marry me?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brightness upon Anne&rsquo;s cheek and in her eyes during
this remark showed that there was a fair quantity of life and
warmth beneath the discretion he complained of.&nbsp; Having
spoken thus, he drew aside that she might pass, and bowed very
low.&nbsp; Anne formally inclined herself and went on.</p>
<p>She had been at vexation point all the time that he was
present, from a haunting sense that he would not have spoken to
her so freely had she been a young woman with thriving male
relatives to keep forward admirers in check.&nbsp; But she had
been struck, now as at their previous meeting, with the power she
possessed of working him up either to irritation or to
complacency at will; and this consciousness of being able to play
upon him as upon an instrument disposed her to a humorous
considerateness, and made her tolerate even while she rebuffed
him.</p>
<p>When Anne got to the hall the farmer, as usual, insisted upon
her reading what he had been unable to get through, and held the
paper tightly in his skinny hand till she had agreed.&nbsp; He
sent her to a hard chair that she could not possibly injure to
the extent of a pennyworth by sitting in it a twelvemonth, and
watched her from the outer angle of his near eye while she bent
over the paper.&nbsp; His look might have been suggested by the
sight that he had witnessed from his window on the last occasion
of her visit, for it partook of the nature of concern.&nbsp; The
old man was afraid of his nephew, physically and morally, and he
began to regard Anne as a fellow-sufferer under the same
despot.&nbsp; After this sly and curious gaze at her he withdrew
his eye again, so that when she casually lifted her own there was
nothing visible but his keen bluish profile as before.</p>
<p>When the reading was about half-way through, the door behind
them opened, and footsteps crossed the threshold.&nbsp; The
farmer diminished perceptibly in his chair, and looked fearful,
but pretended to be absorbed in the reading, and quite
unconscious of an intruder.&nbsp; Anne felt the presence of the
swashing Festus, and stopped her reading.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please go on, Miss Anne,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I am
not going to speak a word.&rsquo;&nbsp; He withdrew to the
mantelpiece and leaned against it at his ease.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on, do ye, maidy Anne,&rsquo; said Uncle Benjy,
keeping down his tremblings by a great effort to half their
natural extent.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s voice became much lower now that there were two
listeners, and her modesty shrank somewhat from exposing to
Festus the appreciative modulations which an intelligent interest
in the subject drew from her when unembarrassed.&nbsp; But she
still went on that he might not suppose her to be disconcerted,
though the ensuing ten minutes was one of disquietude.&nbsp; She
knew that the bothering yeoman&rsquo;s eyes were travelling over
her from his position behind, creeping over her shoulders, up to
her head, and across her arms and hands.&nbsp; Old Benjy on his
part knew the same thing, and after sundry endeavours to peep at
his nephew from the corner of his eye, he could bear the
situation no longer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do ye want to say anything to me, nephew?&rsquo; he
quaked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, uncle, thank ye,&rsquo; said Festus heartily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I like to stay here, thinking of you and looking at your
back hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The nervous old man writhed under this vivisection, and Anne
read on; till, to the relief of both, the gallant fellow grew
tired of his amusement and went out of the room.&nbsp; Anne soon
finished her paragraph and rose to go, determined never to come
again as long as Festus haunted the precincts.&nbsp; Her face
grew warmer as she thought that he would be sure to waylay her on
her journey home to-day.</p>
<p>On this account, when she left the house, instead of going in
the customary direction, she bolted round to the further side,
through the bushes, along under the kitchen-garden wall, and
through a door leading into a rutted cart-track, which had been a
pleasant gravelled drive when the fine old hall was in its
prosperity.&nbsp; Once out of sight of the windows she ran with
all her might till she had quitted the park by a route directly
opposite to that towards her home.&nbsp; Why she was so seriously
bent upon doing this she could hardly tell but the instinct to
run was irresistible.</p>
<p>It was necessary now to clamber over the down to the left of
the camp, and make a complete circuit round the
latter&mdash;infantry, cavalry, sutlers, and all&mdash;descending
to her house on the other side.&nbsp; This tremendous walk she
performed at a rapid rate, never once turning her head, and
avoiding every beaten track to keep clear of the knots of
soldiers taking a walk.&nbsp; When she at last got down to the
levels again she paused to fetch breath, and murmured, &lsquo;Why
did I take so much trouble?&nbsp; He would not, after all, have
hurt me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she neared the mill an erect figure with a blue body and
white thighs descended before her from the down towards the
village, and went past the mill to a stile beyond, over which she
usually returned to her house.&nbsp; Here he lingered.&nbsp; On
coming nearer Anne discovered this person to be Trumpet-major
Loveday; and not wishing to meet anybody just now Anne passed
quickly on, and entered the house by the garden door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Anne, what a time you have been gone!&rsquo;
said her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I have been round by another road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you do that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne looked thoughtful and reticent, for her reason was almost
too silly a one to confess.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I wanted to avoid
a person who is very busy trying to meet me&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Her mother glanced out of the window.&nbsp; &lsquo;And there
he is, I suppose,&rsquo; she said, as John Loveday, tired of
looking for Anne at the stile, passed the house on his way to his
father&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; He could not help casting his eyes
towards their window, and, seeing them, he smiled.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s reluctance to mention Festus was such that she
did not correct her mother&rsquo;s error, and the dame went on:
&lsquo;Well, you are quite right, my dear.&nbsp; Be friendly with
him, but no more at present.&nbsp; I have heard of your other
affair, and think it is a very wise choice.&nbsp; I am sure you
have my best wishes in it, and I only hope it will come to a
point.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; said the astonished Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You and Mr. Festus Derriman, dear.&nbsp; You need not
mind me; I have known it for several days.&nbsp; Old Granny
Seamore called here Saturday, and told me she saw him coming home
with you across Park Close last week, when you went for the
newspaper; so I thought I&rsquo;d send you again to-day, and give
you another chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t want the paper&mdash;and it was
only for that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a very fine young fellow; he looks a
thorough woman&rsquo;s protector.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He may look it,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has given up the freehold farm his father held at
Pitstock, and lives in independence on what the land brings
him.&nbsp; And when Farmer Derriman dies, he&rsquo;ll have all
the old man&rsquo;s, for certain.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be worth ten
thousand pounds, if a penny, in money, besides sixteen horses,
cart and hack, a fifty-cow dairy, and at least five hundred
sheep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne turned away, and instead of informing her mother that she
had been running like a doe to escape the interesting
heir-presumptive alluded to, merely said &lsquo;Mother, I
don&rsquo;t like this at all.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>IX.&nbsp; ANNE IS KINDLY FETCHED BY THE TRUMPET-MAJOR</h2>
<p>After this, Anne would on no account walk in the direction of
the hall for fear of another encounter with young Derriman.&nbsp;
In the course of a few days it was told in the village that the
old farmer had actually gone for a week&rsquo;s holiday and
change of air to the Royal watering-place near at hand, at the
instance of his nephew Festus.&nbsp; This was a wonderful thing
to hear of Uncle Benjy, who had not slept outside the walls of
Oxwell Hall for many a long year before; and Anne well imagined
what extraordinary pressure must have been put upon him to induce
him to take such a step.&nbsp; She pictured his unhappiness at
the bustling watering-place, and hoped no harm would come to
him.</p>
<p>She spent much of her time indoors or in the garden, hearing
little of the camp movements beyond the periodical Ta-ta-ta-taa
of the trumpeters sounding their various ingenious calls for
watch-setting, stables, feed, boot-and-saddle, parade, and so on,
which made her think how clever her friend the trumpet-major must
be to teach his pupils to play those pretty little tunes so
well.</p>
<p>On the third morning after Uncle Benjy&rsquo;s departure, she
was disturbed as usual while dressing by the tramp of the troops
down the slope to the mill-pond, and during the now familiar
stamping and splashing which followed there sounded upon the
glass of the window a slight smack, which might have been caused
by a whip or switch.&nbsp; She listened more particularly, and it
was repeated.</p>
<p>As John Loveday was the only dragoon likely to be aware that
she slept in that particular apartment, she imagined the signal
to come from him, though wondering that he should venture upon
such a freak of familiarity.</p>
<p>Wrapping herself up in a red cloak, she went to the window,
gently drew up a corner of the curtain, and peeped out, as she
had done many times before.&nbsp; Nobody who was not quite close
beneath her window could see her face; but as it happened,
somebody was close.&nbsp; The soldiers whose floundering Anne had
heard were not Loveday&rsquo;s dragoons, but a troop of the York
Hussars, quite oblivious of her existence.&nbsp; They had passed
on out of the water, and instead of them there sat Festus
Derriman alone on his horse, and in plain clothes, the water
reaching up to the animal&rsquo;s belly, and Festus&rsquo; heels
elevated over the saddle to keep them out of the stream, which
threatened to wash rider and horse into the deep mill-head just
below.&nbsp; It was plainly he who had struck her lattice, for in
a moment he looked up, and their eyes met.&nbsp; Festus laughed
loudly, and slapped her window again; and just at that moment the
dragoons began prancing down the slope in review order.&nbsp; She
could not but wait a minute or two to see them pass.&nbsp; While
doing so she was suddenly led to draw back, drop the corner of
the curtain, and blush privately in her room.&nbsp; She had not
only been seen by Festus Derriman, but by John Loveday, who,
riding along with his trumpet slung up behind him, had looked
over his shoulder at the phenomenon of Derriman beneath
Anne&rsquo;s bedroom window and seemed quite astounded at the
sight.</p>
<p>She was quite vexed at the conjunction of incidents, and went
no more to the window till the dragoons had ridden far away and
she had heard Festus&rsquo;s horse laboriously wade on to dry
land.&nbsp; When she looked out there was nobody left but Miller
Loveday, who usually stood in the garden at this time of the
morning to say a word or two to the soldiers, of whom he already
knew so many, and was in a fair way of knowing many more, from
the liberality with which he handed round mugs of cheering liquor
whenever parties of them walked that way.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of this day Anne walked to a christening
party at a neighbour&rsquo;s in the adjoining parish of
Springham, intending to walk home again before it got dark; but
there was a slight fall of rain towards evening, and she was
pressed by the people of the house to stay over the night.&nbsp;
With some hesitation she accepted their hospitality; but at ten
o&rsquo;clock, when they were thinking of going to bed, they were
startled by a smart rap at the door, and on it being unbolted a
man&rsquo;s form was seen in the shadows outside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Miss Garland here?&rsquo; the visitor inquired, at
which Anne suspended her breath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Anne&rsquo;s entertainer, warily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her mother is very anxious to know what&rsquo;s become
of her.&nbsp; She promised to come home.&rsquo;&nbsp; To her
great relief Anne recognized the voice as John Loveday&rsquo;s,
and not Festus Derriman&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I did, Mr. Loveday,&rsquo; said she, coming
forward; &lsquo;but it rained, and I thought my mother would
guess where I was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Loveday said with diffidence that it had not rained anything
to speak of at the camp, or at the mill, so that her mother was
rather alarmed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she asked you to come for me?&rsquo; Anne
inquired.</p>
<p>This was a question which the trumpet-major had been dreading
during the whole of his walk thither.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, she
didn&rsquo;t exactly ask me,&rsquo; he said rather lamely, but
still in a manner to show that Mrs. Garland had indirectly
signified such to be her wish.&nbsp; In reality Mrs. Garland had
not addressed him at all on the subject.&nbsp; She had merely
spoken to his father on finding that her daughter did not return,
and received an assurance from the miller that the precious girl
was doubtless quite safe.&nbsp; John heard of this inquiry, and,
having a pass that evening, resolved to relieve Mrs.
Garland&rsquo;s mind on his own responsibility.&nbsp; Ever since
his morning view of Festus under her window he had been on thorns
of anxiety, and his thrilling hope now was that she would walk
back with him.</p>
<p>He shifted his foot nervously as he made the bold
request.&nbsp; Anne felt at once that she would go.&nbsp; There
was nobody in the world whose care she would more readily be
under than the trumpet-major&rsquo;s in a case like the
present.&nbsp; He was their nearest neighbour&rsquo;s son, and
she had liked his single-minded ingenuousness from the first
moment of his return home.</p>
<p>When they had started on their walk, Anne said in a practical
way, to show that there was no sentiment whatever in her
acceptance of his company, &lsquo;Mother was much alarmed about
me, perhaps?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; she was uneasy,&rsquo; he said; and then was
compelled by conscience to make a clean breast of it.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I know she was uneasy, because my father said so.&nbsp;
But I did not see her myself.&nbsp; The truth is, she
doesn&rsquo;t know I am come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne now saw how the matter stood; but she was not offended
with him.&nbsp; What woman could have been?&nbsp; They walked on
in silence, the respectful trumpet-major keeping a yard off on
her right as precisely as if that measure had been fixed between
them.&nbsp; She had a great feeling of civility toward him this
evening, and spoke again.&nbsp; &lsquo;I often hear your
trumpeters blowing the calls.&nbsp; They do it beautifully, I
think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty fair; they might do better,&rsquo; said he, as
one too well-mannered to make much of an accomplishment in which
he had a hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you taught them how to do it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I taught them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must require wonderful practice to get them into the
way of beginning and finishing so exactly at one time.&nbsp; It
is like one throat doing it all.&nbsp; How came you to be a
trumpeter, Mr. Loveday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I took to it naturally when I was a little
boy,&rsquo; said he, betrayed into quite a gushing state by her
delightful interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;I used to make trumpets of
paper, eldersticks, eltrot stems, and even stinging-nettle
stalks, you know.&nbsp; Then father set me to keep the birds off
that little barley-ground of his, and gave me an old horn to
frighten &rsquo;em with.&nbsp; I learnt to blow that horn so that
you could hear me for miles and miles.&nbsp; Then he bought me a
clarionet, and when I could play that I borrowed a serpent, and I
learned to play a tolerable bass.&nbsp; So when I &lsquo;listed I
was picked out for training as trumpeter at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you were.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sometimes, however, I wish I had never joined the
army.&nbsp; My father gave me a very fair education, and your
father showed me how to draw horses&mdash;on a slate, I
mean.&nbsp; Yes, I ought to have done more than I
have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, did you know my father?&rsquo; she asked with new
interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, for years.&nbsp; You were a little mite of a
thing then; and you used to cry when we big boys looked at you,
and made pig&rsquo;s eyes at you, which we did sometimes.&nbsp;
Many and many a time have I stood by your poor father while he
worked.&nbsp; Ah, you don&rsquo;t remember much about him; but I
do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne remained thoughtful; and the moon broke from behind the
clouds, lighting up the wet foliage with a twinkling brightness,
and lending to each of the trumpet-major&rsquo;s buttons and
spurs a little ray of its own.&nbsp; They had come to Oxwell park
gate, and he said, &lsquo;Do you like going across, or round by
the lane?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We may as well go by the nearest road,&rsquo; said
Anne.</p>
<p>They entered the park, following the half-obliterated drive
till they came almost opposite the hall, when they entered a
footpath leading on to the village.&nbsp; While hereabout they
heard a shout, or chorus of exclamation, apparently from within
the walls of the dark buildings near them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was that?&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said her companion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went round the intervening swamp of watercress and
brooklime which had once been the fish-pond, crossed by a culvert
the trickling brook that still flowed that way, and advanced to
the wall of the house.&nbsp; Boisterous noises were resounding
from within, and he was tempted to go round the corner, where the
low windows were, and look through a chink into the room whence
the sounds proceeded.</p>
<p>It was the room in which the owner dined&mdash;traditionally
called the great parlour&mdash;and within it sat about a dozen
young men of the yeomanry cavalry, one of them being
Festus.&nbsp; They were drinking, laughing, singing, thumping
their fists on the tables, and enjoying themselves in the very
perfection of confusion.&nbsp; The candles, blown by the breeze
from the partly opened window, had guttered into coffin handles
and shrouds, and, choked by their long black wicks for want of
snuffing, gave out a smoky yellow light.&nbsp; One of the young
men might possibly have been in a maudlin state, for he had his
arm round the neck of his next neighbour.&nbsp; Another was
making an incoherent speech to which nobody was listening.&nbsp;
Some of their faces were red, some were sallow; some were sleepy,
some wide awake.&nbsp; The only one among them who appeared in
his usual frame of mind was Festus, whose huge, burly form rose
at the head of the table, enjoying with a serene and triumphant
aspect the difference between his own condition and that of his
neighbours.&nbsp; While the trumpet-major looked, a young woman,
niece of Anthony Cripplestraw, and one of Uncle Benjy&rsquo;s
servants, was called in by one of the crew, and much against her
will a fiddle was placed in her hands, from which they made her
produce discordant screeches.</p>
<p>The absence of Uncle Benjy had, in fact, been contrived by
young Derriman that he might make use of the hall on his own
account.&nbsp; Cripplestraw had been left in charge, and Festus
had found no difficulty in forcing from that dependent the keys
of whatever he required.&nbsp; John Loveday turned his eyes from
the scene to the neighbouring moonlit path, where Anne still
stood waiting.&nbsp; Then he looked into the room, then at Anne
again.&nbsp; It was an opportunity of advancing his own cause
with her by exposing Festus, for whom he began to entertain
hostile feelings of no mean force.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I can&rsquo;t do it,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis underhand.&nbsp; Let things take their
chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He moved away, and then perceived that Anne, tired of waiting,
had crossed the stream, and almost come up with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the noise about?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s company in the house,&rsquo; said
Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Company?&nbsp; Farmer Derriman is not at home,&rsquo;
said Anne, and went on to the window whence the rays of light
leaked out, the trumpet-major standing where he was.&nbsp; He saw
her face enter the beam of candlelight, stay there for a moment,
and quickly withdraw.&nbsp; She came back to him at once.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let us go on,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Loveday imagined from her tone that she must have an interest
in Derriman, and said sadly, &lsquo;You blame me for going across
to the window, and leading you to follow me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit,&rsquo; said Anne, seeing his mistake as to
the state of her heart, and being rather angry with him for
it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think it was most natural, considering the
noise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Silence again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Derriman is sober as a
judge,&rsquo; said Loveday, as they turned to go.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
was only the others who were noisy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether he is sober or not is nothing whatever to
me,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course not.&nbsp; I know it,&rsquo; said the
trumpet-major, in accents expressing unhappiness at her somewhat
curt tone, and some doubt of her assurance.</p>
<p>Before they had emerged from the shadow of the hall some
persons were seen moving along the road.&nbsp; Loveday was for
going on just the same; but Anne, from a shy feeling that it was
as well not to be seen walking alone with a man who was not her
lover, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Loveday, let us wait here a minute till they have
passed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On nearer view the group was seen to comprise a man on a
piebald horse, and another man walking beside him.&nbsp; When
they were opposite the house they halted, and the rider
dismounted, whereupon a dispute between him and the other man
ensued, apparently on a question of money.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis old Mr. Derriman come home!&rsquo; said
Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has hired that horse from the
bathing-machine to bring him.&nbsp; Only fancy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before they had gone many steps further the farmer and his
companion had ended their dispute, and the latter mounted the
horse and cantered away, Uncle Benjy coming on to the house at a
nimble pace.&nbsp; As soon as he observed Loveday and Anne, he
fell into a feebler gait; when they came up he recognized
Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you have torn yourself away from King
George&rsquo;s Esplanade so soon, Farmer Derriman?&rsquo; said
she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, faith!&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t bide at such a
ruination place,&rsquo; said the farmer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your hand
in your pocket every minute of the day.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
shilling for this, half-a-crown for that; if you only eat one
egg, or even a poor windfall of an apple, you&rsquo;ve got to
pay; and a bunch o&rsquo; radishes is a halfpenny, and a quart
o&rsquo; cider a good tuppence three-farthings at lowest
reckoning.&nbsp; Nothing without paying!&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
even get a ride homeward upon that screw without the man wanting
a shilling for it, when my weight didn&rsquo;t take a penny out
of the beast.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve saved a penn&rsquo;orth or so of
shoeleather to be sure; but the saddle was so rough wi&rsquo;
patches that &lsquo;a took twopence out of the seat of my best
breeches.&nbsp; King George hev&rsquo; ruined the town for other
folks.&nbsp; More than that, my nephew promised to come there
to-morrow to see me, and if I had stayed I must have treated
en.&nbsp; Hey&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a shout from within the walls of the building, and
Loveday said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your nephew is here, and has company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My nephew <i>here</i>?&rsquo; gasped the old man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good folks, will you come up to the door with me?&nbsp; I
mean&mdash;hee&mdash;hee&mdash;just for company!&nbsp; Dear me, I
thought my house was as quiet as a church?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went back to the window, and the farmer looked in, his
mouth falling apart to a greater width at the corners than in the
middle, and his fingers assuming a state of radiation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis my best silver tankards they&rsquo;ve got,
that I&rsquo;ve never used!&nbsp; O! &rsquo;tis my strong
beer!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis eight candles guttering away, when
I&rsquo;ve used nothing but twenties myself for the last
half-year!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t know he was here, then?&rsquo; said
Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no!&rsquo; said the farmer, shaking his head
half-way.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing&rsquo;s known to poor I!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s my best rummers jingling as careless as if
&rsquo;twas tin cups; and my table scratched, and my chairs
wrenched out of joint.&nbsp; See how they tilt &rsquo;em on the
two back legs&mdash;and that&rsquo;s ruin to a chair!&nbsp; Ah!
when I be gone he won&rsquo;t find another old man to make such
work with, and provide goods for his breaking, and house-room and
drink for his tear-brass set!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Comrades and fellow-soldiers,&rsquo; said Festus to the
hot farmers and yeomen he entertained within, &lsquo;as we have
vowed to brave danger and death together, so we&rsquo;ll share
the couch of peace.&nbsp; You shall sleep here to-night, for it
is getting late.&nbsp; My scram blue-vinnied gallicrow of an
uncle takes care that there shan&rsquo;t be much comfort in the
house, but you can curl up on the furniture if beds run
short.&nbsp; As for my sleep, it won&rsquo;t be much.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m melancholy!&nbsp; A woman has, I may say, got my heart
in her pocket, and I have hers in mine.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not
much&mdash;to other folk, I mean&mdash;but she is to me.&nbsp;
The little thing came in my way, and conquered me.&nbsp; I fancy
that simple girl!&nbsp; I ought to have looked higher&mdash;I
know it; what of that?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a fate that may happen to
the greatest men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whash her name?&rsquo; said one of the warriors, whose
head occasionally drooped upon his epaulettes, and whose eyes
fell together in the casual manner characteristic of the tired
soldier.&nbsp; (It was really Farmer Stubb, of Duddle Hole.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her name?&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis spelt, A, N&mdash;but,
by gad, I won&rsquo;t give ye her name here in company.&nbsp; She
don&rsquo;t live a hundred miles off, however, and she wears the
prettiest cap-ribbons you ever saw.&nbsp; Well, well, &rsquo;tis
weakness!&nbsp; She has little, and I have much; but I do adore
that girl, in spite of myself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go on,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Prithee stand by an old man till he&rsquo;s got into
his house!&rsquo; implored Uncle Benjy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I only ask
ye to bide within call.&nbsp; Stand back under the trees, and
I&rsquo;ll do my poor best to give no trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stand by you for half-an-hour, sir,&rsquo;
said Loveday.&nbsp; &lsquo;After that I must bolt to
camp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well; bide back there under the trees,&rsquo; said
Uncle Benjy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spite
&rsquo;em?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll wait a few minutes, just to see if he gets
in?&rsquo; said the trumpet-major to Anne as they retired from
the old man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to get home,&rsquo; said Anne anxiously.</p>
<p>When they had quite receded behind the tree-trunks and he
stood alone, Uncle Benjy, to their surprise, set up a loud shout,
altogether beyond the imagined power of his lungs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Man a-lost! man a-lost!&rsquo; he cried, repeating the
exclamation several times; and then ran and hid himself behind a
corner of the building.&nbsp; Soon the door opened, and Festus
and his guests came tumbling out upon the green.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis our duty to help folks in distress,&rsquo;
said Festus.&nbsp; &lsquo;Man a-lost, where are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas across there,&rsquo; said one of his
friends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No! &rsquo;twas here,&rsquo; said another.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Uncle Benjy, coming from his hiding-place, had
scampered with the quickness of a boy up to the door they had
quitted, and slipped in.&nbsp; In a moment the door flew
together, and Anne heard him bolting and barring it inside.&nbsp;
The revellers, however, did not notice this, and came on towards
the spot where the trumpet-major and Anne were standing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s succour at hand, friends,&rsquo; said
Festus.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are all king&rsquo;s men; do not fear
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Loveday; &lsquo;so are
we.&rsquo;&nbsp; He explained in two words that they were not the
distressed traveller who had cried out, and turned to go on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis she! my life, &rsquo;tis she said Festus,
now first recognizing Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fair Anne, I will not
part from you till I see you safe at your own dear
door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s in my hands,&rsquo; said Loveday civilly,
though not without firmness, &lsquo;so it is not required, thank
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Man, had I but my sword&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Loveday, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
quarrel.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s put it to her.&nbsp; Whichever of us
she likes best, he shall take her home.&nbsp; Miss Anne,
which?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne would much rather have gone home alone, but seeing the
remainder of the yeomanry party staggering up she thought it best
to secure a protector of some kind.&nbsp; How to choose one
without offending the other and provoking a quarrel was the
difficulty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must both walk home with me,&rsquo; she adroitly
said, &lsquo;one on one side, and one on the other.&nbsp; And if
you are not quite civil to one another all the time, I&rsquo;ll
never speak to either of you again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They agreed to the terms, and the other yeomen arriving at
this time said they would go also as rearguard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now go and
get your hats, and don&rsquo;t be long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes; our hats,&rsquo; said the yeomanry, whose
heads were so hot that they had forgotten their nakedness till
then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll wait till we&rsquo;ve got
&rsquo;em&mdash;we won&rsquo;t be a moment,&rsquo; said Festus
eagerly.</p>
<p>Anne and Loveday said yes, and Festus ran back to the house,
followed by all his band.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now let&rsquo;s run and leave &rsquo;em,&rsquo; said
Anne, when they were out of hearing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we&rsquo;ve promised to wait!&rsquo; said the
trumpet-major in surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Promised to wait!&rsquo; said Anne indignantly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As if one ought to keep such a promise to drunken men as
that.&nbsp; You can do as you like, I shall go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is hardly fair to leave the chaps,&rsquo; said
Loveday reluctantly, and looking back at them.&nbsp; But she
heard no more, and flitting off under the trees, was soon lost to
his sight.</p>
<p>Festus and the rest had by this time reached Uncle
Benjy&rsquo;s door, which they were discomfited and astonished to
find closed.&nbsp; They began to knock, and then to kick at the
venerable timber, till the old man&rsquo;s head, crowned with a
tasselled nightcap, appeared at an upper window, followed by his
shoulders, with apparently nothing on but his shirt, though it
was in truth a sheet thrown over his coat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fie, fie upon ye all for making such a hullaballoo at a
weak old man&rsquo;s door,&rsquo; he said, yawning.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s in ye to rouse honest folks at this time
o&rsquo; night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hang me&mdash;why&mdash;it&rsquo;s Uncle Benjy!&nbsp;
Haw&mdash;haw&mdash;haw?&rsquo; said Festus.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nunc,
why how the devil&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
I&mdash;Festus&mdash;wanting to come in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no, my clever man, whoever you be!&rsquo; said
Uncle Benjy in a tone of incredulous integrity.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
nephew, dear boy, is miles away at quarters, and sound asleep by
this time, as becomes a good soldier.&nbsp; That story
won&rsquo;t do to-night, my man, not at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my soul &rsquo;tis I,&rsquo; said Festus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to-night, my man; not to-night!&nbsp; Anthony,
bring my blunderbuss,&rsquo; said the farmer, turning and
addressing nobody inside the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s break in the window-shutters,&rsquo; said
one of the others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My wig, and we will!&rsquo; said Festus.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What a trick of the old man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get some big stones,&rsquo; said the yeomen, searching
under the wall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; forbear, forbear,&rsquo; said Festus, beginning to
be frightened at the spirit he had raised.&nbsp; &lsquo;I forget;
we should drive him into fits, for he&rsquo;s subject to
&rsquo;em, and then perhaps &rsquo;twould be manslaughter.&nbsp;
Comrades, we must march!&nbsp; No, we&rsquo;ll lie in the
barn.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see into this, take my word for
&lsquo;t.&nbsp; Our honour is at stake.&nbsp; Now let&rsquo;s
back to see my beauty home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t, as we hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got our
hats,&rsquo; said one of his fellow-troopers&mdash;in domestic
life Jacob Noakes, of Muckleford Farm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more we can,&rsquo; said Festus, in a melancholy
tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I must go to her and tell her the
reason.&nbsp; She pulls me in spite of all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp; I saw her flee across park
while we were knocking at the door,&rsquo; said another of the
yeomanry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone!&rsquo; said Festus, grinding his teeth and
putting himself into a rigid shape.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then &rsquo;tis
my enemy&mdash;he has tempted her away with him!&nbsp; But I am a
rich man, and he&rsquo;s poor, and rides the King&rsquo;s horse
while I ride my own.&nbsp; Could I but find that fellow, that
regular, that common man, I would&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; said the trumpet-major, coming up behind
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I,&rsquo;&mdash;said Festus, starting
round,&mdash;&lsquo;I would seize him by the hand and say,
&ldquo;Guard her; if you are my friend, guard her from all
harm!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A good speech.&nbsp; And I will, too,&rsquo; said
Loveday heartily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now for shelter,&rsquo; said Festus to his
companions.</p>
<p>They then unceremoniously left Loveday, without wishing him
good-night, and proceeded towards the barn.&nbsp; He crossed the
park and ascended the down to the camp, grieved that he had given
Anne cause of complaint, and fancying that she held him of slight
account beside his wealthier rival.</p>
<h2>X. THE MATCH-MAKING VIRTUES OF A DOUBLE GARDEN</h2>
<p>Anne was so flurried by the military incidents attending her
return home that she was almost afraid to venture alone outside
her mother&rsquo;s premises.&nbsp; Moreover, the numerous
soldiers, regular and otherwise, that haunted Overcombe and its
neighbourhood, were getting better acquainted with the villagers,
and the result was that they were always standing at garden
gates, walking in the orchards, or sitting gossiping just within
cottage doors, with the bowls of their tobacco-pipes thrust
outside for politeness&rsquo; sake, that they might not defile
the air of the household.&nbsp; Being gentlemen of a gallant and
most affectionate nature, they naturally turned their heads and
smiled if a pretty girl passed by, which was rather disconcerting
to the latter if she were unused to society.&nbsp; Every belle in
the village soon had a lover, and when the belles were all
allotted those who scarcely deserved that title had their turn,
many of the soldiers being not at all particular about
half-an-inch of nose more or less, a trifling deficiency of
teeth, or a larger crop of freckles than is customary in the
Saxon race.&nbsp; Thus, with one and another, courtship began to
be practised in Overcombe on rather a large scale, and the
dispossessed young men who had been born in the place were left
to take their walks alone, where, instead of studying the works
of nature, they meditated gross outrages on the brave men who had
been so good as to visit their village.</p>
<p>Anne watched these romantic proceedings from her window with
much interest, and when she saw how triumphantly other handsome
girls of the neighbourhood walked by on the gorgeous arms of
Lieutenant Knockheelmann, Cornet Flitzenhart, and Captain
Klaspenkissen, of the thrilling York Hussars, who swore the most
picturesque foreign oaths, and had a wonderful sort of estate or
property called the Vaterland in their country across the sea,
she was filled with a sense of her own loneliness.&nbsp; It made
her think of things which she tried to forget, and to look into a
little drawer at something soft and brown that lay in a curl
there, wrapped in paper.&nbsp; At last she could bear it no
longer, and went downstairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To see the folks, because I am so gloomy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not at present, Anne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not, mother?&rsquo; said Anne, blushing with an
indefinite sense of being very wicked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you must not.&nbsp; I have been going to tell
you several times not to go into the street at this time of
day.&nbsp; Why not walk in the morning?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s young
Mr. Derriman would be glad to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention him, mother,
don&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well then, dear, walk in the garden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So poor Anne, who really had not the slightest wish to throw
her heart away upon a soldier, but merely wanted to displace old
thoughts by new, turned into the inner garden from day to day,
and passed a good many hours there, the pleasant birds singing to
her, and the delightful butterflies alighting on her hat, and the
horrid ants running up her stockings.</p>
<p>This garden was undivided from Loveday&rsquo;s, the two having
originally been the single garden of the whole house.&nbsp; It
was a quaint old place, enclosed by a thorn hedge so shapely and
dense from incessant clipping that the mill-boy could walk along
the top without sinking in&mdash;a feat which he often performed
as a means of filling out his day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; The soil
within was of that intense fat blackness which is only seen after
a century of constant cultivation.&nbsp; The paths were grassed
over, so that people came and went upon them without being
heard.&nbsp; The grass harboured slugs, and on this account the
miller was going to replace it by gravel as soon as he had time;
but as he had said this for thirty years without doing it, the
grass and the slugs seemed likely to remain.</p>
<p>The miller&rsquo;s man attended to Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s piece
of the garden as well as to the larger portion, digging,
planting, and weeding indifferently in both, the miller observing
with reason that it was not worth while for a helpless widow lady
to hire a man for her little plot when his man, working
alongside, could tend it without much addition to his
labour.&nbsp; The two households were on this account even more
closely united in the garden than within the mill.&nbsp; Out
there they were almost one family, and they talked from plot to
plot with a zest and animation which Mrs. Garland could never
have anticipated when she first removed thither after her
husband&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The lower half of the garden, farthest from the road, was the
most snug and sheltered part of this snug and sheltered
enclosure, and it was well watered as the land of Lot.&nbsp;
Three small brooks, about a yard wide, ran with a tinkling sound
from side to side between the plots, crossing the path under wood
slabs laid as bridges, and passing out of the garden through
little tunnels in the hedge.&nbsp; The brooks were so far
overhung at their brinks by grass and garden produce that, had it
not been for their perpetual babbling, few would have noticed
that they were there.&nbsp; This was where Anne liked best to
linger when her excursions became restricted to her own premises;
and in a spot of the garden not far removed the trumpet-major
loved to linger also.</p>
<p>Having by virtue of his office no stable duty to perform, he
came down from the camp to the mill almost every day; and Anne,
finding that he adroitly walked and sat in his father&rsquo;s
portion of the garden whenever she did so in the other half,
could not help smiling and speaking to him.&nbsp; So his
epaulettes and blue jacket, and Anne&rsquo;s yellow gipsy hat,
were often seen in different parts of the garden at the same
time; but he never intruded into her part of the enclosure, nor
did she into Loveday&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She always spoke to him when
she saw him there, and he replied in deep, firm accents across
the gooseberry bushes, or through the tall rows of flowering
peas, as the case might be.&nbsp; He thus gave her accounts at
fifteen paces of his experiences in camp, in quarters, in
Flanders, and elsewhere; of the difference between line and
column, of forced marches, billeting, and such-like, together
with his hopes of promotion.&nbsp; Anne listened at first
indifferently; but knowing no one else so good-natured and
experienced, she grew interested in him as in a brother.&nbsp; By
degrees his gold lace, buckles, and spurs lost all their
strangeness and were as familiar to her as her own clothes.</p>
<p>At last Mrs. Garland noticed this growing friendship, and
began to despair of her motherly scheme of uniting Anne to the
moneyed Festus.&nbsp; Why she could not take prompt steps to
check interference with her plans arose partly from her nature,
which was the reverse of managing, and partly from a new
emotional circumstance with which she found it difficult to
reckon.&nbsp; The near neighbourhood that had produced the
friendship of Anne for John Loveday was slowly effecting a warmer
liking between her mother and his father.</p>
<p>Thus the month of July passed.&nbsp; The troop horses came
with the regularity of clockwork twice a day down to drink under
her window, and, as the weather grew hotter, kicked up their
heels and shook their heads furiously under the maddening sting
of the dun-fly.&nbsp; The green leaves in the garden became of a
darker dye, the gooseberries ripened, and the three brooks were
reduced to half their winter volume.</p>
<p>At length the earnest trumpet-major obtained Mrs.
Garland&rsquo;s consent to take her and her daughter to the camp,
which they had not yet viewed from any closer point than their
own windows.&nbsp; So one afternoon they went, the miller being
one of the party.&nbsp; The villagers were by this time driving a
roaring trade with the soldiers, who purchased of them every
description of garden produce, milk, butter, and eggs at liberal
prices.&nbsp; The figures of these rural sutlers could be seen
creeping up the slopes, laden like bees, to a spot in the rear of
the camp, where there was a kind of market-place on the
greensward.</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland, Anne, and the miller were conducted from one
place to another, and on to the quarter where the soldiers&rsquo;
wives lived who had not been able to get lodgings in the cottages
near.&nbsp; The most sheltered place had been chosen for them,
and snug huts had been built for their use by their husbands, of
clods, hurdles, a little thatch, or whatever they could lay hands
on.&nbsp; The trumpet-major conducted his friends thence to the
large barn which had been appropriated as a hospital, and to the
cottage with its windows bricked up, that was used as the
magazine; then they inspected the lines of shining dark horses
(each representing the then high figure of two-and-twenty guineas
purchase money), standing patiently at the ropes which stretched
from one picket-post to another, a bank being thrown up in front
of them as a protection at night.</p>
<p>They passed on to the tents of the German Legion, a well-grown
and rather dandy set of men, with a poetical look about their
faces which rendered them interesting to feminine eyes.&nbsp;
Hanoverians, Saxons, Prussians, Swedes, Hungarians, and other
foreigners were numbered in their ranks.&nbsp; They were cleaning
arms, which they leant carefully against a rail when the work was
complete.</p>
<p>On their return they passed the mess-house, a temporary wooden
building with a brick chimney.&nbsp; As Anne and her companions
went by, a group of three or four of the hussars were standing at
the door talking to a dashing young man, who was expatiating on
the qualities of a horse that one was inclined to buy.&nbsp; Anne
recognized Festus Derriman in the seller, and Cripplestraw was
trotting the animal up and down.&nbsp; As soon as she caught the
yeoman&rsquo;s eye he came forward, making some friendly remark
to the miller, and then turning to Miss Garland, who kept her
eyes steadily fixed on the distant landscape till he got so near
that it was impossible to do so longer.&nbsp; Festus looked from
Anne to the trumpet-major, and from the trumpet-major back to
Anne, with a dark expression of face, as if he suspected that
there might be a tender understanding between them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you offended with me?&rsquo; he said to her in a
low voice of repressed resentment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When are you coming to the hall again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, perhaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Anne,&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland, who had come
near, and smiled pleasantly on Festus.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can go at
any time, as usual.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let her come with me now, Mrs. Garland; I should be
pleased to walk along with her.&nbsp; My man can lead home the
horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, but I shall not come,&rsquo; said Miss Anne
coldly.</p>
<p>The widow looked unhappily in her daughter&rsquo;s face,
distressed between her desire that Anne should encourage Festus,
and her wish to consult Anne&rsquo;s own feelings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave her alone, leave her alone,&rsquo; said Festus,
his gaze blackening.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now I think of it I am glad she
can&rsquo;t come with me, for I am engaged;&rsquo; and he stalked
away.</p>
<p>Anne moved on with her mother, young Loveday silently
following, and they began to descend the hill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, where&rsquo;s Mr. Loveday?&rsquo; asked Mrs.
Garland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father&rsquo;s behind,&rsquo; said John.</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland looked behind her solicitously; and the miller,
who had been waiting for the event, beckoned to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll overtake you in a minute,&rsquo; she said to
the younger pair, and went back, her colour, for some
unaccountable reason, rising as she did so.&nbsp; The miller and
she then came on slowly together, conversing in very low tones,
and when they got to the bottom they stood still.&nbsp; Loveday
and Anne waited for them, saying but little to each other, for
the rencounter with Festus had damped the spirits of both.&nbsp;
At last the widow&rsquo;s private talk with Miller Loveday came
to an end, and she hastened onward, the miller going in another
direction to meet a man on business.&nbsp; When she reached the
trumpet-major and Anne she was looking very bright and rather
flurried, and seemed sorry when Loveday said that he must leave
them and return to the camp.&nbsp; They parted in their usual
friendly manner, and Anne and her mother were left to walk the
few remaining yards alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, I&rsquo;ve settled it,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Garland.&nbsp; &lsquo;Anne, what are you thinking about?&nbsp; I
have settled in my mind that it is all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s all right?&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you do not care for Derriman, and mean to
encourage John Loveday.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s all the world so long
as folks are happy!&nbsp; Child, don&rsquo;t take any notice of
what I have said about Festus, and don&rsquo;t meet him any
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a weathercock you are, mother!&nbsp; Why should
you say that just now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is easy to call me a weathercock,&rsquo; said the
matron, putting on the look of a good woman; &lsquo;but I have
reasoned it out, and at last, thank God, I have got over my
ambition.&nbsp; The Lovedays are our true and only friends, and
Mr. Festus Derriman, with all his money, is nothing to us at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Anne, &lsquo;what has made you change
all of a sudden from what you have said before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My feelings and my reason, which I am thankful
for!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne knew that her mother&rsquo;s sentiments were naturally so
versatile that they could not be depended on for two days
together; but it did not occur to her for the moment that a
change had been helped on in the present case by a romantic talk
between Mrs. Garland and the miller.&nbsp; But Mrs. Garland could
not keep the secret long.&nbsp; She chatted gaily as she walked,
and before they had entered the house she said, &lsquo;What do
you think Mr Loveday has been saying to me, dear Anne?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne did not know at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, he has asked me to marry him.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>XI.&nbsp; OUR PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF
ROYALTY</h2>
<p>To explain the miller&rsquo;s sudden proposal it is only
necessary to go back to that moment when Anne, Festus, and Mrs.
Garland were talking together on the down.&nbsp; John Loveday had
fallen behind so as not to interfere with a meeting in which he
was decidedly superfluous; and his father, who guessed the
trumpet-major&rsquo;s secret, watched his face as he stood.&nbsp;
John&rsquo;s face was sad, and his eyes followed Mrs.
Garland&rsquo;s encouraging manner to Festus in a way which
plainly said that every parting of her lips was tribulation to
him.&nbsp; The miller loved his son as much as any miller or
private gentleman could do, and he was pained to see John&rsquo;s
gloom at such a trivial circumstance.&nbsp; So what did he
resolve but to help John there and then by precipitating a matter
which, had he himself been the only person concerned, he would
have delayed for another six months.</p>
<p>He had long liked the society of his impulsive, tractable
neighbour, Mrs. Garland; had mentally taken her up and pondered
her in connexion with the question whether it would not be for
the happiness of both if she were to share his home, even though
she was a little his superior in antecedents and knowledge.&nbsp;
In fact he loved her; not tragically, but to a very creditable
extent for his years; that is, next to his sons, Bob and John,
though he knew very well of that ploughed-ground appearance near
the corners of her once handsome eyes, and that the little
depression in her right cheek was not the lingering dimple it was
poetically assumed to be, but a result of the abstraction of some
worn-out nether millstones within the cheek by Rootle, the
Budmouth man, who lived by such practices on the heads of the
elderly.&nbsp; But what of that, when he had lost two to each one
of hers, and exceeded her in age by some eight years!&nbsp; To do
John a service, then, he quickened his designs, and put the
question to her while they were standing under the eyes of the
younger pair.</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland, though she had been interested in the miller for
a long time, and had for a moment now and then thought on this
question as far as, &lsquo;Suppose he should, &lsquo;If he were
to,&rsquo; and so on, had never thought much further; and she was
really taken by surprise when the question came.&nbsp; She
answered without affectation that she would think over the
proposal; and thus they parted.</p>
<p>Her mother&rsquo;s infirmity of purpose set Anne thinking, and
she was suddenly filled with a conviction that in such a case she
ought to have some purpose herself.&nbsp; Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s
complacency at the miller&rsquo;s offer had, in truth, amazed
her.&nbsp; While her mother had held up her head, and recommended
Festus, it had seemed a very pretty thing to rebel; but the
pressure being removed an awful sense of her own responsibility
took possession of her mind.&nbsp; As there was no longer anybody
to be wise or ambitious for her, surely she should be wise and
ambitious for herself, discountenance her mother&rsquo;s
attachment, and encourage Festus in his addresses, for her own
and her mother&rsquo;s good.&nbsp; There had been a time when a
Loveday thrilled her own heart; but that was long ago, before she
had thought of position or differences.&nbsp; To wake into cold
daylight like this, when and because her mother had gone into the
land of romance, was dreadful and new to her, and like an
increase of years without living them.</p>
<p>But it was easier to think that she ought to marry the yeoman
than to take steps for doing it; and she went on living just as
before, only with a little more thoughtfulness in her eyes.</p>
<p>Two days after the visit to the camp, when she was again in
the garden, Soldier Loveday said to her, at a distance of five
rows of beans and a parsley-bed&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have heard the news, Miss Garland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Anne, without looking up from a book
she was reading.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The King is coming to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The King?&rsquo; She looked up then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; to Gloucester Lodge; and he will pass this
way.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t arrive till long past the middle of the
night, if what they say is true, that he is timed to change
horses at Woodyates Inn&mdash;between Mid and South
Wessex&mdash;at twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; continued Loveday,
encouraged by her interest to cut off the parsley-bed from the
distance between them.</p>
<p>Miller Loveday came round the corner of the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have ye heard about the King coming, Miss Maidy
Anne?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Anne said that she had just heard of it; and the
trumpet-major, who hardly welcomed his father at such a moment,
explained what he knew of the matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you will go with your regiment to meet &lsquo;en, I
suppose?&rsquo; said old Loveday.</p>
<p>Young Loveday said that the men of the German Legion were to
perform that duty.&nbsp; And turning half from his father, and
half towards Anne, he added, in a tentative tone, that he thought
he might get leave for the night, if anybody would like to be
taken to the top of the Ridgeway over which the royal party must
pass.</p>
<p>Anne, knowing by this time of the budding hope in the gallant
dragoon&rsquo;s mind, and not wishing to encourage it, said,
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The miller looked disappointed as well as John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your mother might like to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am going indoors, and I&rsquo;ll ask her if you
wish me to,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>She went indoors and rather coldly told her mother of the
proposal.&nbsp; Mrs. Garland, though she had determined not to
answer the miller&rsquo;s question on matrimony just yet, was
quite ready for this jaunt, and in spite of Anne she sailed off
at once to the garden to hear more about it.&nbsp; When she
re-entered, she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anne, I have not seen the King or the King&rsquo;s
horses for these many years; and I am going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, it is well to be you, mother,&rsquo; said Anne, in
an elderly tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you won&rsquo;t come with us?&rsquo; said Mrs.
Garland, rather rebuffed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have very different things to think of,&rsquo; said
her daughter with virtuous emphasis, &lsquo;than going to see
sights at that time of night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland was sorry, but resolved to adhere to the
arrangement.&nbsp; The night came on; and it having gone abroad
that the King would pass by the road, many of the villagers went
out to see the procession.&nbsp; When the two Lovedays and Mrs.
Garland were gone, Anne bolted the door for security, and sat
down to think again on her grave responsibilities in the choice
of a husband, now that her natural guardian could no longer be
trusted.</p>
<p>A knock came to the door.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s instinct was at once to be silent, that the comer
might think the family had retired.</p>
<p>The knocking person, however, was not to be easily
persuaded.&nbsp; He had in fact seen rays of light over the top
of the shutter, and, unable to get an answer, went on to the door
of the mill, which was still going, the miller sometimes grinding
all night when busy.&nbsp; The grinder accompanied the stranger
to Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The daughter is certainly at home, sir,&rsquo; said the
grinder.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go round to t&rsquo;other side,
and see if she&rsquo;s there, Master Derriman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to take her out to see the King,&rsquo; said
Festus.</p>
<p>Anne had started at the sound of the voice.&nbsp; No
opportunity could have been better for carrying out her new
convictions on the disposal of her hand.&nbsp; But in her mortal
dislike of Festus, Anne forgot her principles, and her idea of
keeping herself above the Lovedays.&nbsp; Tossing on her hat and
blowing out the candle, she slipped out at the back door, and
hastily followed in the direction that her mother and the rest
had taken.&nbsp; She overtook them as they were beginning to
climb the hill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! you have altered your mind after all?&rsquo; said
the widow.&nbsp; &lsquo;How came you to do that, my
dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I might as well come,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure you did,&rsquo; said the miller
heartily.&nbsp; &lsquo;A good deal better than biding at home
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John said nothing, though she could almost see through the
gloom how glad he was that she had altered her mind.&nbsp; When
they reached the ridge over which the highway stretched they
found many of their neighbours who had got there before them
idling on the grass border between the roadway and the hedge,
enjoying a sort of midnight picnic, which it was easy to do, the
air being still and dry.&nbsp; Some carriages were also standing
near, though most people of the district who possessed four
wheels, or even two, had driven into the town to await the King
there.&nbsp; From this height could be seen in the distance the
position of the watering-place, an additional number of lanterns,
lamps, and candles having been lighted to-night by the loyal
burghers to grace the royal entry, if it should occur before
dawn.</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland touched Anne&rsquo;s elbow several times as they
walked, and the young woman at last understood that this was
meant as a hint to her to take the trumpet-major&rsquo;s arm,
which its owner was rather suggesting than offering to her.&nbsp;
Anne wondered what infatuation was possessing her mother,
declined to take the arm, and contrived to get in front with the
miller, who mostly kept in the van to guide the others&rsquo;
footsteps.&nbsp; The trumpet-major was left with Mrs. Garland,
and Anne&rsquo;s encouraging pursuit of them induced him to say a
few words to the former.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By your leave, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ll speak to you on
something that concerns my mind very much indeed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is my wish to be allowed to pay my addresses to your
daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you meant that,&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland
simply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you&rsquo;ll not object?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall leave it to her.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think she
will agree, even if I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The soldier sighed, and seemed helpless.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I
can but ask her,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>The spot on which they had finally chosen to wait for the King
was by a field gate, whence the white road could be seen for a
long distance northwards by day, and some little distance
now.&nbsp; They lingered and lingered, but no King came to break
the silence of that beautiful summer night.&nbsp; As half-hour
after half-hour glided by, and nobody came, Anne began to get
weary; she knew why her mother did not propose to go back, and
regretted the reason.&nbsp; She would have proposed it herself,
but that Mrs. Garland seemed so cheerful, and as wide awake as at
noonday, so that it was almost a cruelty to disturb her.</p>
<p>The trumpet-major at last made up his mind, and tried to draw
Anne into a private conversation.&nbsp; The feeling which a week
ago had been a vague and piquant aspiration, was to-day
altogether too lively for the reasoning of this warm-hearted
soldier to regulate.&nbsp; So he persevered in his intention to
catch her alone, and at last, in spite of her manoeuvres to the
contrary, he succeeded.&nbsp; The miller and Mrs. Garland had
walked about fifty yards further on, and Anne and himself were
left standing by the gate.</p>
<p>But the gallant musician&rsquo;s soul was so much disturbed by
tender vibrations and by the sense of his presumption that he
could not begin; and it may be questioned if he would ever have
broached the subject at all, had not a distant church clock
opportunely assisted him by striking the hour of three.&nbsp; The
trumpet-major heaved a breath of relief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That clock strikes in G sharp,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed&mdash;G sharp?&rsquo; said Anne civilly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a fine-toned bell.&nbsp; I used
to notice that note when I was a boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you&mdash;the very same?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and since then I had a wager about that bell with
the bandmaster of the North Wessex Militia.&nbsp; He said the
note was G; I said it wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; When we found it G
sharp we didn&rsquo;t know how to settle it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not a deep note for a clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no!&nbsp; The finest tenor bell about here is the
bell of Peter&rsquo;s, Casterbridge&mdash;in E flat.&nbsp;
Tum-m-m-m&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
note&mdash;tum-m-m-m.&rsquo;&nbsp; The trumpet-major sounded from
far down his throat what he considered to be E flat, with a
parenthetic sense of luxury unquenchable even by his present
distraction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we go on to where my mother is?&rsquo; said Anne,
less impressed by the beauty of the note than the trumpet-major
himself was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In one minute,&rsquo; he said tremulously.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Talking of music&mdash;I fear you don&rsquo;t think the
rank of a trumpet-major much to compare with your own?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do.&nbsp; I think a trumpet-major a very respectable
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear you say that.&nbsp; It is given out
by the King&rsquo;s command that trumpet-majors are to be
considered respectable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Then I am, by chance, more loyal than I
thought for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I get a good deal a year extra to the trumpeters,
because of my position.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s very nice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I am not supposed ever to drink with the trumpeters
who serve beneath me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Naturally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, by the orders of the War Office, I am to exert
over them (that&rsquo;s the government word) exert over them full
authority; and if any one behaves towards me with the least
impropriety, or neglects my orders, he is to be confined and
reported.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is really a dignified post,&rsquo; she said, with,
however, a reserve of enthusiasm which was not altogether
encouraging.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And of course some day I shall,&rsquo; stammered the
dragoon&mdash;&lsquo;shall be in rather a better position than I
am at present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear it, Mr. Loveday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And in short, Mistress Anne,&rsquo; continued John
Loveday bravely and desperately, &lsquo;may I pay court to you in
the hope that&mdash;no, no, don&rsquo;t go away!&mdash;you
haven&rsquo;t heard yet&mdash;that you may make me the happiest
of men; not yet, but when peace is proclaimed and all is smooth
and easy again?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t put it any better, though
there&rsquo;s more to be explained.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is most awkward,&rsquo; said Anne, evidently with
pain.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot possibly agree; believe me, Mr.
Loveday, I cannot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there&rsquo;s more than this.&nbsp; You would be
surprised to see what snug rooms the married trumpet- and
sergeant-majors have in quarters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Barracks are not all; consider camp and war.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That brings me to my strong point!&rsquo; exclaimed the
soldier hopefully.&nbsp; &lsquo;My father is better off than most
non-commissioned officers&rsquo; fathers; and there&rsquo;s
always a home for you at his house in any emergency.&nbsp; I can
tell you privately that he has enough to keep us both, and if you
wouldn&rsquo;t hear of barracks, well, peace once established,
I&rsquo;d live at home as a miller and farmer&mdash;next door to
your own mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My mother would be sure to object,&rsquo; expostulated
Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; she leaves it all to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! you have asked her?&rsquo; said Anne, with
surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I thought it would not be honourable to act
otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s very good of you,&rsquo; said Anne, her
face warming with a generous sense of his
straightforwardness.&nbsp; &lsquo;But my mother is so entirely
ignorant of a soldier&rsquo;s life, and the life of a
soldier&rsquo;s wife&mdash;she is so simple in all such matters,
that I cannot listen to you any more readily for what she may
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is all over for me,&rsquo; said the poor
trumpet-major, wiping his face and putting away his handkerchief
with an air of finality.</p>
<p>Anne was silent.&nbsp; Any woman who has ever tried will know
without explanation what an unpalatable task it is to dismiss,
even when she does not love him, a man who has all the natural
and moral qualities she would desire, and only fails in the
social.&nbsp; Would-be lovers are not so numerous, even with the
best women, that the sacrifice of one can be felt as other than a
good thing wasted, in a world where there are few good
things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not angry, Miss Garland?&rsquo; said he,
finding that she did not speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let us say anything more about
this now.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she moved on.</p>
<p>When she drew near to the miller and her mother she perceived
that they were engaged in a conversation of that peculiar kind
which is all the more full and communicative from the fact of
definitive words being few.&nbsp; In short, here the game was
succeeding which with herself had failed.&nbsp; It was pretty
clear from the symptoms, marks, tokens, telegraphs, and general
byplay between widower and widow, that Miller Loveday must have
again said to Mrs. Garland some such thing as he had said before,
with what result this time she did not know.</p>
<p>As the situation was delicate, Anne halted awhile apart from
them.&nbsp; The trumpet-major, quite ignorant of how his cause
was entered into by the white-coated man in the distance (for his
father had not yet told him of his designs upon Mrs. Garland),
did not advance, but stood still by the gate, as though he were
attending a princess, waiting till he should be called up.&nbsp;
Thus they lingered, and the day began to break.&nbsp; Mrs.
Garland and the miller took no heed of the time, and what it was
bringing to earth and sky, so occupied were they with themselves;
but Anne in her place and the trumpet-major in his, each in
private thought of no bright kind, watched the gradual glory of
the east through all its tones and changes.&nbsp; The world of
birds and insects got lively, the blue and the yellow and the
gold of Loveday&rsquo;s uniform again became distinct; the sun
bored its way upward, the fields, the trees, and the distant
landscape kindled to flame, and the trumpet-major, backed by a
lilac shadow as tall as a steeple, blazed in the rays like a very
god of war.</p>
<p>It was half-past three o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; A short time
after, a rattle of horses and wheels reached their ears from the
quarter in which they gazed, and there appeared upon the white
line of road a moving mass, which presently ascended the hill and
drew near.</p>
<p>Then there arose a huzza from the few knots of watchers
gathered there, and they cried, &lsquo;Long live King
Jarge!&rsquo;&nbsp; The cortege passed abreast.&nbsp; It
consisted of three travelling-carriages, escorted by a detachment
of the German Legion.&nbsp; Anne was told to look in the first
carriage&mdash;a post-chariot drawn by four horses&mdash;for the
King and Queen, and was rewarded by seeing a profile reminding
her of the current coin of the realm; but as the party had been
travelling all night, and the spectators here gathered were few,
none of the royal family looked out of the carriage
windows.&nbsp; It was said that the two elder princesses were in
the same carriage, but they remained invisible.&nbsp; The next
vehicle, a coach and four, contained more princesses, and the
third some of their attendants.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God, I have seen my King!&rsquo; said Mrs.
Garland, when they had all gone by.</p>
<p>Nobody else expressed any thankfulness, for most of them had
expected a more pompous procession than the bucolic tastes of the
King cared to indulge in; and one old man said grimly that that
sight of dusty old leather coaches was not worth waiting
for.&nbsp; Anne looked hither and thither in the bright rays of
the day, each of her eyes having a little sun in it, which gave
her glance a peculiar golden fire, and kindled the brown curls
grouped over her forehead to a yellow brilliancy, and made single
hairs, blown astray by the night, look like lacquered
wires.&nbsp; She was wondering if Festus were anywhere near, but
she could not see him.</p>
<p>Before they left the ridge they turned their attention towards
the Royal watering-place, which was visible at this place only as
a portion of the sea-shore, from which the night-mist was rolling
slowly back.&nbsp; The sea beyond was still wrapped in summer
fog, the ships in the roads showing through it as black spiders
suspended in the air.&nbsp; While they looked and walked a white
jet of smoke burst from a spot which the miller knew to be the
battery in front of the King&rsquo;s residence, and then the
report of guns reached their ears.&nbsp; This announcement was
answered by a salute from the Castle of the adjoining Isle, and
the ships in the neighbouring anchorage.&nbsp; All the bells in
the town began ringing.&nbsp; The King and his family had
arrived.</p>
<h2>XII.&nbsp; HOW EVERYBODY GREAT AND SMALL CLIMBED TO THE TOP
OF THE DOWNS</h2>
<p>As the days went on, echoes of the life and bustle of the town
reached the ears of the quiet people in Overcombe
hollow&mdash;exciting and moving those unimportant natives as a
ground-swell moves the weeds in a cave.&nbsp;
Travelling-carriages of all kinds and colours climbed and
descended the road that led towards the seaside borough.&nbsp;
Some contained those personages of the King&rsquo;s suite who had
not kept pace with him in his journey from Windsor; others were
the coaches of aristocracy, big and little, whom news of the
King&rsquo;s arrival drew thither for their own pleasure: so that
the highway, as seen from the hills about Overcombe, appeared
like an ant-walk&mdash;a constant succession of dark spots
creeping along its surface at nearly uniform rates of progress,
and all in one direction.</p>
<p>The traffic and intelligence between camp and town passed in a
measure over the villagers&rsquo; heads.&nbsp; It being summer
time the miller was much occupied with business, and the
trumpet-major was too constantly engaged in marching between the
camp and Gloucester Lodge with the rest of the dragoons to bring
his friends any news for some days.</p>
<p>At last he sent a message that there was to be a review on the
downs by the King, and that it was fixed for the day
following.&nbsp; This information soon spread through the village
and country round, and next morning the whole population of
Overcombe&mdash;except two or three very old men and women, a few
babies and their nurses, a cripple, and Corporal
Tullidge&mdash;ascended the slope with the crowds from afar, and
awaited the events of the day.</p>
<p>The miller wore his best coat on this occasion, which meant a
good deal.&nbsp; An Overcombe man in those days would have a best
coat, and keep it as a best coat half his life.&nbsp; The
miller&rsquo;s had seen five and twenty summers chiefly through
the chinks of a clothes-box, and was not at all shabby as yet,
though getting singular.&nbsp; But that could not be helped;
common coats and best coats were distinct species, and never
interchangeable.&nbsp; Living so near the scene of the review he
walked up the hill, accompanied by Mrs. Garland and Anne as
usual.</p>
<p>It was a clear day, with little wind stirring, and the view
from the downs, one of the most extensive in the county, was
unclouded.&nbsp; The eye of any observer who cared for such
things swept over the wave-washed town, and the bay beyond, and
the Isle, with its pebble bank, lying on the sea to the left of
these, like a great crouching animal tethered to the
mainland.&nbsp; On the extreme east of the marine horizon, St.
Aldhelm&rsquo;s Head closed the scene, the sea to the southward
of that point glaring like a mirror under the sun.&nbsp; Inland
could be seen Badbury Rings, where a beacon had been recently
erected; and nearer, Rainbarrow, on Egdon Heath, where another
stood: farther to the left Bulbarrow, where there was yet
another.&nbsp; Not far from this came Nettlecombe Tout; to the
west, Dogberry Hill, and Black&rsquo;on near to the foreground,
the beacon thereon being built of furze faggots thatched with
straw, and standing on the spot where the monument now raises its
head.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock the troops marched upon the
ground&mdash;some from the camps in the vicinity, and some from
quarters in the different towns round about.&nbsp; The approaches
to the down were blocked with carriages of all descriptions,
ages, and colours, and with pedestrians of every class.&nbsp; At
ten the royal personages were said to be drawing near, and soon
after the King, accompanied by the Dukes of Cambridge and
Cumberland, and a couple of generals, appeared on horseback,
wearing a round hat turned up at the side, with a cockade and
military feather.&nbsp; (Sensation among the crowd.)&nbsp; Then
the Queen and three of the princesses entered the field in a
great coach drawn by six beautiful cream-coloured horses.&nbsp;
Another coach, with four horses of the same sort, brought the two
remaining princesses.&nbsp; (Confused acclamations,
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s King Jarge!&rsquo; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Queen
Sharlett!&rsquo; &lsquo;Princess &rsquo;Lizabeth!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Princesses Sophiar and Meelyer!&rsquo; etc., from the
surrounding spectators.)</p>
<p>Anne and her party were fortunate enough to secure a position
on the top of one of the barrows which rose here and there on the
down; and the miller having gallantly constructed a little cairn
of flints, he placed the two women thereon, by which means they
were enabled to see over the heads, horses, and coaches of the
multitudes below and around.&nbsp; At the march-past the
miller&rsquo;s eye, which had been wandering about for the
purpose, discovered his son in his place by the trumpeters, who
had moved forwards in two ranks, and were sounding the march.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s John!&rsquo; he cried to the widow.&nbsp;
&lsquo;His trumpet-sling is of two colours, d&rsquo;ye see; and
the others be plain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland too saw him now, and enthusiastically admired him
from her hands upwards, and Anne silently did the same.&nbsp; But
before the young woman&rsquo;s eyes had quite left the
trumpet-major they fell upon the figure of Yeoman Festus riding
with his troop, and keeping his face at a medium between
haughtiness and mere bravery.&nbsp; He certainly looked as
soldierly as any of his own corps, and felt more soldierly than
half-a-dozen, as anybody could see by observing him.&nbsp; Anne
got behind the miller, in case Festus should discover her, and,
regardless of his monarch, rush upon her in a rage with,
&lsquo;Why the devil did you run away from me that
night&mdash;hey, madam?&rsquo;&nbsp; But she resolved to think no
more of him just now, and to stick to Loveday, who was her
mother&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; In this she was helped by the
stirring tones which burst from the latter gentleman and his
subordinates from time to time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the miller complacently,
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s few of more consequence in a regiment than a
trumpeter.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the chap that tells &rsquo;em what to
do, after all.&nbsp; Hey, Mrs. Garland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So he is, miller,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They could no more do without Jack and his men than
they could without generals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed they could not,&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland again,
in a tone of pleasant agreement with any one in Great Britain or
Ireland.</p>
<p>It was said that the line that day was three miles long,
reaching from the high ground on the right of where the people
stood to the turnpike road on the left.&nbsp; After the review
came a sham fight, during which action the crowd dispersed more
widely over the downs, enabling Widow Garland to get still
clearer glimpses of the King, and his handsome charger, and the
head of the Queen, and the elbows and shoulders of the princesses
in the carriages, and fractional parts of General Garth and the
Duke of Cumberland; which sights gave her great
gratification.&nbsp; She tugged at her daughter at every
opportunity, exclaiming, &lsquo;Now you can see his
feather!&rsquo; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s her hat!&rsquo;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s her Majesty&rsquo;s India muslin
shawl!&rsquo; in a minor form of ecstasy, that made the miller
think her more girlish and animated than her daughter Anne.</p>
<p>In those military manoeuvres the miller followed the fortunes
of one man; Anne Garland of two.&nbsp; The spectators, who,
unlike our party, had no personal interest in the soldiery, saw
only troops and battalions in the concrete, straight lines of
red, straight lines of blue, white lines formed of innumerable
knee-breeches, black lines formed of many gaiters, coming and
going in kaleidoscopic change.&nbsp; Who thought of every point
in the line as an isolated man, each dwelling all to himself in
the hermitage of his own mind?&nbsp; One person did, a young man
far removed from the barrow where the Garlands and Miller Loveday
stood.&nbsp; The natural expression of his face was somewhat
obscured by the bronzing effects of rough weather, but the lines
of his mouth showed that affectionate impulses were strong within
him&mdash;perhaps stronger than judgment well could
regulate.&nbsp; He wore a blue jacket with little brass buttons,
and was plainly a seafaring man.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the part of the plain where rose the tumulus on
which the miller had established himself, a broad-brimmed
tradesman was elbowing his way along.&nbsp; He saw Mr. Loveday
from the base of the barrow, and beckoned to attract his
attention.&nbsp; Loveday went halfway down, and the other came up
as near as he could.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miller,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;a letter has been
lying at the post-office for you for the last three days.&nbsp;
If I had known that I should see ye here I&rsquo;d have brought
it along with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The miller thanked him for the news, and they parted, Loveday
returning to the summit.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a very strange
thing!&rsquo; he said to Mrs. Garland, who had looked inquiringly
at his face, now very grave.&nbsp; &lsquo;That was Budmouth
postmaster, and he says there&rsquo;s a letter for me.&nbsp; Ah,
I now call to mind that there <i>was</i> a letter in the candle
three days ago this very night&mdash;a large red one; but
foolish-like I thought nothing o&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Who <i>can</i>
that letter be from?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A letter at this time was such an event for hamleteers, even
of the miller&rsquo;s respectable standing, that Loveday
thenceforward was thrown into a fit of abstraction which
prevented his seeing any more of the sham fight, or the people,
or the King.&nbsp; Mrs. Garland imbibed some of his concern, and
suggested that the letter might come from his son Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should naturally have thought that,&rsquo; said
Miller Loveday; &lsquo;but he wrote to me only two months ago,
and his brother John heard from him within the last four weeks,
when he was just about starting on another voyage.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;ll pardon me, Mrs. Garland, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ll see
if there&rsquo;s any Overcombe man here who is going to Budmouth
to-day, so that I may get the letter by night-time.&nbsp; I
cannot possibly go myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Mr. Loveday left them for awhile; and as they were so near
home Mrs. Garland did not wait on the barrow for him to come
back, but walked about with Anne a little time, until they should
be disposed to trot down the slope to their own door.&nbsp; They
listened to a man who was offering one guinea to receive ten in
case Buonaparte should be killed in three months, and to other
entertainments of that nature, which at this time were not
rare.&nbsp; Once during their peregrination the eyes of the
sailor before-mentioned fell upon Anne; but he glanced over her
and passed her unheedingly by.&nbsp; Loveday the elder was at
this time on the other side of the line, looking for a messenger
to the town.&nbsp; At twelve o&rsquo;clock the review was over,
and the King and his family left the hill.&nbsp; The troops then
cleared off the field, the spectators followed, and by one
o&rsquo;clock the downs were again bare.</p>
<p>They still spread their grassy surface to the sun as on that
beautiful morning not, historically speaking, so very long ago;
but the King and his fifteen thousand armed men, the horses, the
bands of music, the princesses, the cream-coloured
teams&mdash;the gorgeous centre-piece, in short, to which the
downs were but the mere mount or margin&mdash;how entirely have
they all passed and gone!&mdash;lying scattered about the world
as military and other dust, some at Talavera, Albuera, Salamanca,
Vittoria, Toulouse, and Waterloo; some in home churchyards; and a
few small handfuls in royal vaults.</p>
<p>In the afternoon John Loveday, lightened of his trumpet and
trappings, appeared at the old mill-house door, and beheld Anne
standing at hers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw you, Miss Garland,&rsquo; said the soldier
gaily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where was I?&rsquo; said she, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the top of the big mound&mdash;to the right of the
King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I saw you; lots of times,&rsquo; she rejoined.</p>
<p>Loveday seemed pleased.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you really take the
trouble to find me?&nbsp; That was very good of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her eyes followed you everywhere,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Garland from an upper window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I looked at the dragoons most,&rsquo; said
Anne, disconcerted.&nbsp; &lsquo;And when I looked at them my
eyes naturally fell upon the trumpets.&nbsp; I looked at the
dragoons generally, no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not mean to show any vexation to the trumpet-major,
but he fancied otherwise, and stood repressed.&nbsp; The
situation was relieved by the arrival of the miller, still
looking serious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very much concerned, John; I did not go to the
review for nothing.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a letter a-waiting for me
at Budmouth, and I must get it before bedtime, or I shan&rsquo;t
sleep a wink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go, of course,&rsquo; said John; &lsquo;and
perhaps Miss Garland would like to see what&rsquo;s doing there
to-day?&nbsp; Everybody is gone or going; the road is like a
fair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke pleadingly, but Anne was not won to assent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can drive in the gig; &rsquo;twill do Blossom
good,&rsquo; said the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let David drive Miss Garland,&rsquo; said the
trumpet-major, not wishing to coerce her; &lsquo;I would just as
soon walk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne joyfully welcomed this arrangement, and a time was fixed
for the start.</p>
<h2>XIII.&nbsp; THE CONVERSATION IN THE CROWD</h2>
<p>In the afternoon they drove off, John Loveday being nowhere
visible.&nbsp; All along the road they passed and were overtaken
by vehicles of all descriptions going in the same direction;
among them the extraordinary machines which had been invented for
the conveyance of troops to any point of the coast on which the
enemy should land; they consisted of four boards placed across a
sort of trolly, thirty men of the volunteer companies riding on
each.</p>
<p>The popular Georgian watering-place was in a paroxysm of
gaiety.&nbsp; The town was quite overpowered by the country
round, much to the town&rsquo;s delight and profit.&nbsp; The
fear of invasion was such that six frigates lay in the roads to
ensure the safety of the royal family, and from the regiments of
horse and foot quartered at the barracks, or encamped on the
hills round about, a picket of a thousand men mounted guard every
day in front of Gloucester Lodge, where the King resided.&nbsp;
When Anne and her attendant reached this point, which they did on
foot, stabling the horse on the outskirts of the town, it was
about six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The King was on the Esplanade, and
the soldiers were just marching past to mount guard.&nbsp; The
band formed in front of the King, and all the officers saluted as
they went by.</p>
<p>Anne now felt herself close to and looking into the stream of
recorded history, within whose banks the littlest things are
great, and outside which she and the general bulk of the human
race were content to live on as an unreckoned, unheeded
superfluity.</p>
<p>When she turned from her interested gaze at this scene, there
stood John Loveday.&nbsp; She had had a presentiment that he
would turn up in this mysterious way.&nbsp; It was marvellous
that he could have got there so quickly; but there he
was&mdash;not looking at the King, or at the crowd, but waiting
for the turn of her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trumpet-major, I didn&rsquo;t see you,&rsquo; said Anne
demurely.&nbsp; &lsquo;How is it that your regiment is not
marching past?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We take it by turns, and it is not our turn,&rsquo;
said Loveday.</p>
<p>She wanted to know then if they were afraid that the King
would be carried off by the First Consul.&nbsp; Yes, Loveday told
her; and his Majesty was rather venturesome.&nbsp; A day or two
before he had gone so far to sea that he was nearly caught by
some of the enemy&rsquo;s cruisers.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is anxious to
fight Boney single-handed,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a good, brave King!&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>Loveday seemed anxious to come to more personal matters.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Will you let me take you round to the other side, where
you can see better?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Queen and
the princesses are at the window.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne passively assented.&nbsp; &lsquo;David, wait here for
me,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I shall be back again in a few
minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The trumpet-major then led her off triumphantly, and they
skirted the crowd and came round on the side towards the
sands.&nbsp; He told her everything he could think of, military
and civil, to which Anne returned pretty syllables and
parenthetic words about the colour of the sea and the curl of the
foam&mdash;a way of speaking that moved the soldier&rsquo;s heart
even more than long and direct speeches would have done.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that other thing I asked you?&rsquo; he ventured to
say at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We won&rsquo;t speak of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t dislike me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no!&rsquo; she said, gazing at the bathing-machines,
digging children, and other common objects of the seashore, as if
her interest lay there rather than with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I am not worthy of the daughter of a genteel
professional man&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s something more than worthiness required
in such cases, you know,&rsquo; she said, still without calling
her mind away from surrounding scenes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, there are
the Queen and princesses at the window!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something more?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, since you will make me speak, I mean the woman
ought to love the man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The trumpet-major seemed to be less concerned about this than
about her supposed superiority.&nbsp; &lsquo;If it were all right
on that point, would you mind the other?&rsquo; he asked, like a
man who knows he is too persistent, yet who cannot be still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I say, when I don&rsquo;t know?&nbsp; What a
pretty chip hat the elder princess wears?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her companion&rsquo;s general disappointment extended over him
almost to his lace and his plume.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your mother said,
you know, Miss Anne&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the worst of it,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us go back to David; I have seen all I
want to see, Mr. Loveday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The mass of the people had by this time noticed the Queen and
princesses at the window, and raised a cheer, to which the ladies
waved their embroidered handkerchiefs.&nbsp; Anne went back
towards the pavement with her trumpet-major, whom all the girls
envied her, so fine-looking a soldier was he; and not only for
that, but because it was well known that he was not a soldier
from necessity, but from patriotism, his father having repeatedly
offered to set him up in business: his artistic taste in
preferring a horse and uniform to a dirty, rumbling flour-mill
was admired by all.&nbsp; She, too, had a very nice appearance in
her best clothes as she walked along&mdash;the sarcenet hat,
muslin shawl, and tight-sleeved gown being of the newest
Overcombe fashion, that was only about a year old in the
adjoining town, and in London three or four.&nbsp; She could not
be harsh to Loveday and dismiss him curtly, for his musical
pursuits had refined him, educated him, and made him quite
poetical.&nbsp; To-day he had been particularly well-mannered and
tender; so, instead of answering, &lsquo;Never speak to me like
this again,&rsquo; she merely put him off with a &lsquo;Let us go
back to David.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the place where they had left him David was
gone.</p>
<p>Anne was now positively vexed.&nbsp; &lsquo;What <i>shall</i>
I do?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s only gone to drink the King&rsquo;s
health,&rsquo; said Loveday, who had privately given David the
money for performing that operation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Depend upon it,
he&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you go and find him?&rsquo; said she, with intense
propriety in her looks and tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Loveday reluctantly; and he
went.</p>
<p>Anne stood still.&nbsp; She could now escape her gallant
friend, for, although the distance was long, it was not
impossible to walk home.&nbsp; On the other hand, Loveday was a
good and sincere fellow, for whom she had almost a brotherly
feeling, and she shrank from such a trick.&nbsp; While she stood
and mused, scarcely heeding the music, the marching of the
soldiers, the King, the dukes, the brilliant staff, the
attendants, and the happy groups of people, her eyes fell upon
the ground.</p>
<p>Before her she saw a flower lying&mdash;a crimson
sweet-william&mdash;fresh and uninjured.&nbsp; An instinctive
wish to save it from destruction by the passengers&rsquo; feet
led her to pick it up; and then, moved by a sudden
self-consciousness, she looked around.&nbsp; She was standing
before an inn, and from an upper window Festus Derriman was
leaning with two or three kindred spirits of his cut and
kind.&nbsp; He nodded eagerly, and signified to her that he had
thrown the flower.</p>
<p>What should she do?&nbsp; To throw it away would seem stupid,
and to keep it was awkward.&nbsp; She held it between her finger
and thumb, twirled it round on its axis and twirled it back
again, regarding and yet not examining it.&nbsp; Just then she
saw the trumpet-major coming back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t find David anywhere,&rsquo; he said; and
his heart was not sorry as he said it.</p>
<p>Anne was still holding out the sweet-william as if about to
drop it, and, scarcely knowing what she did under the distressing
sense that she was watched, she offered the flower to
Loveday.</p>
<p>His face brightened with pleasure as he took it.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thank you, indeed,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then Anne saw what a misleading blunder she had committed
towards Loveday in playing to the yeoman.&nbsp; Perhaps she had
sown the seeds of a quarrel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was not my sweet-william,&rsquo; she said hastily;
&lsquo;it was lying on the ground.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean
anything by giving it to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll keep it all the same,&rsquo; said the
innocent soldier, as if he knew a good deal about womankind; and
he put the flower carefully inside his jacket, between his white
waistcoat and his heart.</p>
<p>Festus, seeing this, enlarged himself wrathfully, got hot in
the face, rose to his feet, and glared down upon them like a
turnip-lantern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us go away,&rsquo; said Anne timorously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see you safe to your own door, depend upon
me,&rsquo; said Loveday.&nbsp; &lsquo;But&mdash;I had near
forgot&mdash;there&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s letter, that he&rsquo;s
so anxiously waiting for!&nbsp; Will you come with me to the
post-office?&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;ll take you straight
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne, expecting Festus to pounce down every minute, was glad
to be off anywhere; so she accepted the suggestion, and they went
along the parade together.</p>
<p>Loveday set this down as a proof of Anne&rsquo;s
relenting.&nbsp; Thus in joyful spirits he entered the office,
paid the postage, and received the letter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is from Bob, after all!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Father told me to read it at once, in case of bad
news.&nbsp; Ask your pardon for keeping you a
moment.&rsquo;&nbsp; He broke the seal and read, Anne standing
silently by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is coming home <i>to be married</i>,&rsquo; said the
trumpet-major, without looking up.</p>
<p>Anne did not answer.&nbsp; The blood swept impetuously up her
face at his words, and as suddenly went away again, leaving her
rather paler than before.&nbsp; She disguised her agitation and
then overcame it, Loveday observing nothing of this emotional
performance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As far as I can understand he will be here
Saturday,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Anne quite calmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
who is he going to marry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said John, turning the
letter about.&nbsp; &lsquo;The woman is a stranger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the miller entered the office hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, John,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;I have been waiting
and waiting for that there letter till I was nigh
crazy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>John briefly explained the news, and when his father had
recovered from his astonishment, taken off his hat, and wiped the
exact line where his forehead joined his hair, he walked with
Anne up the street, leaving John to return alone.&nbsp; The
miller was so absorbed in his mental perspective of Bob&rsquo;s
marriage, that he saw nothing of the gaieties they passed
through; and Anne seemed also so much impressed by the same
intelligence, that she crossed before the inn occupied by Festus
without showing a recollection of his presence there.</p>
<h2>XIV.&nbsp; LATER IN THE EVENING OF THE SAME DAY</h2>
<p>When they reached home the sun was going down.&nbsp; It had
already been noised abroad that miller Loveday had received a
letter, and, his cart having been heard coming up the lane, the
population of Overcombe drew down towards the mill as soon as he
had gone indoors&mdash;a sudden flash of brightness from the
window showing that he had struck such an early light as nothing
but the immediate deciphering of literature could require.&nbsp;
Letters were matters of public moment, and everybody in the
parish had an interest in the reading of those rare documents; so
that when the miller had placed the candle, slanted himself, and
called in Mrs. Garland to have her opinion on the meaning of any
hieroglyphics that he might encounter in his course, he found
that he was to be additionally assisted by the opinions of the
other neighbours, whose persons appeared in the doorway, partly
covering each other like a hand of cards, yet each showing a
large enough piece of himself for identification.&nbsp; To pass
the time while they were arranging themselves, the miller adopted
his usual way of filling up casual intervals, that of snuffing
the candle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We heard you had got a letter, Maister Loveday,&rsquo;
they said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; &ldquo;Southampton, the twelfth of August, dear
father,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Loveday; and they were as silent as
relations at the reading of a will.&nbsp; Anne, for whom the
letter had a singular fascination, came in with her mother and
sat down.</p>
<p>Bob stated in his own way that having, since landing, taken
into consideration his father&rsquo;s wish that he should
renounce a seafaring life and become a partner in the mill, he
had decided to agree to the proposal; and with that object in
view he would return to Overcombe in three days from the time of
writing.</p>
<p>He then said incidentally that since his voyage he had been in
lodgings at Southampton, and during that time had become
acquainted with a lovely and virtuous young maiden, in whom he
found the exact qualities necessary to his happiness.&nbsp;
Having known this lady for the full space of a fortnight he had
had ample opportunities of studying her character, and, being
struck with the recollection that, if there was one thing more
than another necessary in a mill which had no mistress, it was
somebody who could play that part with grace and dignity, he had
asked Miss Matilda Johnson to be his wife.&nbsp; In her kindness
she, though sacrificing far better prospects, had agreed; and he
could not but regard it as a happy chance that he should have
found at the nick of time such a woman to adorn his home, whose
innocence was as stunning as her beauty.&nbsp; Without much ado,
therefore, he and she had arranged to be married at once, and at
Overcombe, that his father might not be deprived of the pleasures
of the wedding feast.&nbsp; She had kindly consented to follow
him by land in the course of a few days, and to live in the house
as their guest for the week or so previous to the ceremony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a proper good letter,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Comfort from the background.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never heerd true love
better put out of hand in my life; and they seem &rsquo;nation
fond of one another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He haven&rsquo;t knowed her such a very long
time,&rsquo; said Job Mitchell dubiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rsquo; said Esther Beach.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nater will find her way, very rapid when the time&rsquo;s
come for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis good news for ye,
miller.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sure, I hope &rsquo;tis,&rsquo; said Loveday,
without, however, showing any great hurry to burst into the
frantic form of fatherly joy which the event should naturally
have produced, seeming more disposed to let off his feelings by
examining thoroughly into the fibres of the letter-paper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was five years a-courting my wife,&rsquo; he
presently remarked.&nbsp; &lsquo;But folks were slower about
everything in them days.&nbsp; Well, since she&rsquo;s coming we
must make her welcome.&nbsp; Did any of ye catch by my reading
which day it is he means?&nbsp; What with making out the
penmanship, my mind was drawn off from the sense here and
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He says in three days,&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The date of the letter will fix it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On examination it was found that the day appointed was the one
nearly expired; at which the miller jumped up and said,
&lsquo;Then he&rsquo;ll be here before bedtime.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t gather till now that he was coming afore
Saturday.&nbsp; Why, he may drop in this very minute!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had scarcely spoken when footsteps were heard coming along
the front, and they presently halted at the door.&nbsp; Loveday
pushed through the neighbours and rushed out; and, seeing in the
passage a form which obscured the declining light, the miller
seized hold of him, saying, &lsquo;O my dear Bob; then you are
come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scrounch it all, miller, don&rsquo;t quite pull my poor
shoulder out of joint!&nbsp; Whatever is the matter?&rsquo; said
the new-comer, trying to release himself from Loveday&rsquo;s
grasp of affection.&nbsp; It was Uncle Benjy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thought &rsquo;twas my son!&rsquo; faltered the miller,
sinking back upon the toes of the neighbours who had closely
followed him into the entry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, come in, Mr.
Derriman, and make yerself at home.&nbsp; Why, you haven&rsquo;t
been here for years!&nbsp; Whatever has made you come now, sir,
of all times in the world?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he in there with ye?&rsquo; whispered the farmer
with misgiving.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My nephew, after that maid that he&rsquo;s so mighty
smit with?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no; he never calls here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Farmer Derriman breathed a breath of relief.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve called to tell ye,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;that there&rsquo;s more news of the French.&nbsp; We shall
have &rsquo;em here this month as sure as a gun.&nbsp; The
gunboats be all ready&mdash;near two thousand of
&rsquo;em&mdash;and the whole army is at Boulogne.&nbsp; And,
miller, I know ye to be an honest man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Loveday did not say nay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neighbour Loveday, I know ye to be an honest
man,&rsquo; repeated the old squireen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can I speak
to ye alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the house was full, Loveday took him into the garden, all
the while upon tenter-hooks, not lest Buonaparte should appear in
their midst, but lest Bob should come whilst he was not there to
receive him.&nbsp; When they had got into a corner Uncle Benjy
said, &lsquo;Miller, what with the French, and what with my
nephew Festus, I assure ye my life is nothing but wherrit from
morning to night.&nbsp; Miller Loveday, you are an honest
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Loveday nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve come to ask a favour&mdash;to ask if
you will take charge of my few poor title-deeds and documents and
suchlike, while I am away from home next week, lest anything
should befall me, and they should be stole away by Boney or
Festus, and I should have nothing left in the wide world?&nbsp; I
can trust neither banks nor lawyers in these terrible times; and
I am come to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Loveday after some hesitation agreed to take care of anything
that Derriman should bring, whereupon the farmer said he would
call with the parchments and papers alluded to in the course of a
week.&nbsp; Derriman then went away by the garden gate, mounted
his pony, which had been tethered outside, and rode on till his
form was lost in the shades.</p>
<p>The miller rejoined his friends, and found that in the
meantime John had arrived.&nbsp; John informed the company that
after parting from his father and Anne he had rambled to the
harbour, and discovered the Pewit by the quay.&nbsp; On inquiry
he had learnt that she came in at eleven o&rsquo;clock, and that
Bob had gone ashore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll go and meet him,&rsquo; said the
miller.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis still light out of
doors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, as the dew rose from the meads and formed fleeces in the
hollows, Loveday and his friends and neighbours strolled out, and
loitered by the stiles which hampered the footpath from Overcombe
to the high road at intervals of a hundred yards.&nbsp; John
Loveday, being obliged to return to camp, was unable to accompany
them, but Widow Garland thought proper to fall in with the
procession.&nbsp; When she had put on her bonnet she called to
her daughter.&nbsp; Anne said from upstairs that she was coming
in a minute; and her mother walked on without her.</p>
<p>What was Anne doing?&nbsp; Having hastily unlocked a
receptacle for emotional objects of small size, she took thence
the little folded paper with which we have already become
acquainted, and, striking a light from her private tinder-box,
she held the paper, and curl of hair it contained, in the candle
till they were burnt.&nbsp; Then she put on her hat and followed
her mother and the rest of them across the moist grey fields,
cheerfully singing in an undertone as she went, to assure herself
of her indifference to circumstances.</p>
<h2>XV.&nbsp; &lsquo;CAPTAIN&rsquo; BOB LOVEDAY OF THE MERCHANT
SERVICE</h2>
<p>While Loveday and his neighbours were thus rambling forth,
full of expectancy, some of them, including Anne in the rear,
heard the crackling of light wheels along the curved lane to
which the path was the chord.&nbsp; At once Anne thought,
&lsquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s he, and we are missing
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; But recent events were not of a kind to induce
her to say anything; and the others of the company did not
reflect on the sound.</p>
<p>Had they gone across to the hedge which hid the lane, and
looked through it, they would have seen a light cart driven by a
boy, beside whom was seated a seafaring man, apparently of good
standing in the merchant service, with his feet outside on the
shaft.&nbsp; The vehicle went over the main bridge, turned in
upon the other bridge at the tail of the mill, and halted by the
door.&nbsp; The sailor alighted, showing himself to be a
well-shaped, active, and fine young man, with a bright eye, an
anonymous nose, and of such a rich complexion by exposure to
ripening suns that he might have been some connexion of the
foreigner who calls his likeness the Portrait of a Gentleman in
galleries of the Old Masters.&nbsp; Yet in spite of this, and
though Bob Loveday had been all over the world from Cape Horn to
Pekin, and from India&rsquo;s coral strand to the White Sea, the
most conspicuous of all the marks that he had brought back with
him was an increased resemblance to his mother, who had lain all
the time beneath Overcombe church wall.</p>
<p>Captain Loveday tried the house door; finding this locked he
went to the mill door: this was locked also, the mill being
stopped for the night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are not at home,&rsquo; he said to the boy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But never mind that.&nbsp; Just help to unload the things
and then I&rsquo;ll pay you, and you can drive off
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The cart was unloaded, and the boy was dismissed, thanking the
sailor profusely for the payment rendered.&nbsp; Then Bob
Loveday, finding that he had still some leisure on his hands,
looked musingly east, west, north, south, and nadir; after which
he bestirred himself by carrying his goods, article by article,
round to the back door, out of the way of casual passers.&nbsp;
This done, he walked round the mill in a more regardful attitude,
and surveyed its familiar features one by one&mdash;the panes of
the grinding-room, now as heretofore clouded with flour as with
stale hoar-frost; the meal lodged in the corners of the
window-sills, forming a soil in which lichens grew without ever
getting any bigger, as they had done since his smallest infancy;
the mosses on the plinth towards the river, reaching as high as
the capillary power of the walls would fetch up moisture for
their nourishment, and the penned mill-pond, now as ever on the
point of overflowing into the garden.&nbsp; Everything was the
same.</p>
<p>When he had had enough of this it occurred to Loveday that he
might get into the house in spite of the locked doors; and by
entering the garden, placing a pole from the fork of an
apple-tree to the window-sill of a bedroom on that side, and
climbing across like a Barbary ape, he entered the window and
stepped down inside.&nbsp; There was something anomalous in being
close to the familiar furniture without having first seen his
father, and its silent, impassive shine was not cheering; it was
as if his relations were all dead, and only their tables and
chests of drawers left to greet him.&nbsp; He went downstairs and
seated himself in the dark parlour.&nbsp; Finding this place,
too, rather solitary, and the tick of the invisible clock
preternaturally loud, he unearthed the tinder-box, obtained a
light, and set about making the house comfortable for his
father&rsquo;s return, divining that the miller had gone out to
meet him by the wrong road.</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s interest in this work increased as he
proceeded, and he bustled round and round the kitchen as lightly
as a girl.&nbsp; David, the indoor factotum, having lost himself
among the quart pots of Budmouth, there had been nobody left here
to prepare supper, and Bob had it all to himself.&nbsp; In a
short time a fire blazed up the chimney, a tablecloth was found,
the plates were clapped down, and a search made for what
provisions the house afforded, which, in addition to various
meats, included some fresh eggs of the elongated shape that
produces cockerels when hatched, and had been set aside on that
account for putting under the next broody hen.</p>
<p>A more reckless cracking of eggs than that which now went on
had never been known in Overcombe since the last large
christening; and as Loveday gashed one on the side, another at
the end, another longways, and another diagonally, he acquired
adroitness by practice, and at last made every son of a hen of
them fall into two hemispheres as neatly as if it opened by a
hinge.&nbsp; From eggs he proceeded to ham, and from ham to
kidneys, the result being a brilliant fry.</p>
<p>Not to be tempted to fall to before his father came back, the
returned navigator emptied the whole into a dish, laid a plate
over the top, his coat over the plate, and his hat over his
coat.&nbsp; Thus completely stopping in the appetizing smell, he
sat down to await events.&nbsp; He was relieved from the
tediousness of doing this by hearing voices outside; and in a
minute his father entered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Glad to welcome ye home, father,&rsquo; said Bob.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And supper is just ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lard, lard&mdash;why, Captain Bob&rsquo;s here!&rsquo;
said Mrs. Garland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And we&rsquo;ve been out waiting to meet thee!&rsquo;
said the miller, as he entered the room, followed by
representatives of the houses of Cripplestraw, Comfort, Mitchell,
Beach, and Snooks, together with some small beginnings of
Fencible Tremlett&rsquo;s posterity.&nbsp; In the rear came
David, and quite in the vanishing-point of the composition, Anne
the fair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I drove over; and so was forced to come by the
road,&rsquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And we went across the fields, thinking you&rsquo;d
walk,&rsquo; said his father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should have been here this morning; but not so much
as a wheelbarrow could I get for my traps; everything was gone to
the review.&nbsp; So I went too, thinking I might meet you
there.&nbsp; I was then obliged to return to the harbour for the
luggage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then there was a welcoming of Captain Bob by pulling out his
arms like drawers and shutting them again, smacking him on the
back as if he were choking, holding him at arm&rsquo;s length as
if he were of too large type to read close.&nbsp; All which
persecution Bob bore with a wide, genial smile that was shaken
into fragments and scattered promiscuously among the
spectators.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get a chair for &rsquo;n!&rsquo; said the miller to
David, whom they had met in the fields and found to have got
nothing worse by his absence than a slight slant in his walk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind&mdash;I am not tired&mdash;I have been here
ever so long,&rsquo; said Bob.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
I&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; But the chair having been placed behind
him, and a smart touch in the hollow of a person&rsquo;s knee by
the edge of that piece of furniture having a tendency to make the
person sit without further argument, Bob sank down dumb, and the
others drew up other chairs at a convenient nearness for easy
analytic vision and the subtler forms of good fellowship.&nbsp;
The miller went about saying, &lsquo;David, the nine best glasses
from the corner cupboard!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;David, the
corkscrew!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;David, whisk the tail of thy
smock-frock round the inside of these quart pots afore you draw
drink in &rsquo;em&mdash;they be an inch thick in
dust!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;David, lower that chimney-crook a
couple of notches that the flame may touch the bottom of the
kettle, and light three more of the largest
candles!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t get the cork out
of the jar, David, bore a hole in the tub of Hollands
that&rsquo;s buried under the scroff in the fuel-house;
d&rsquo;ye hear?&mdash;Dan Brown left en there yesterday as a
return for the little porker I gied en.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they had all had a thimbleful round, and the superfluous
neighbours had reluctantly departed, one by one, the inmates gave
their minds to the supper, which David had begun to serve up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What be you rolling back the tablecloth for,
David?&rsquo; said the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maister Bob have put down one of the under sheets by
mistake, and I thought you might not like it, sir, as
there&rsquo;s ladies present!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith, &rsquo;twas the first thing that came to
hand,&rsquo; said Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;It seemed a tablecloth to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind&mdash;don&rsquo;t pull off the things now
he&rsquo;s laid &rsquo;em down&mdash;let it bide,&rsquo; said the
miller.&nbsp; &lsquo;But where&rsquo;s Widow Garland and Maidy
Anne?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were here but a minute ago,&rsquo; said
David.&nbsp; &lsquo;Depend upon it they have slinked off
&lsquo;cause they be shy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The miller at once went round to ask them to come back and sup
with him; and while he was gone David told Bob in confidence what
an excellent place he had for an old man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Cap&rsquo;n Bob, as I suppose I must call ye;
I&rsquo;ve worked for yer father these eight-and-thirty years,
and we have always got on very well together.&nbsp; Trusts me
with all the keys, lends me his sleeve-waistcoat, and leaves the
house entirely to me.&nbsp; Widow Garland next door, too, is just
the same with me, and treats me as if I was her own
child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must have married young to make you that,
David.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes&mdash;I&rsquo;m years older than she.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis only my common way of speaking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland would not come in to supper, and the meal
proceeded without her, Bob recommending to his father the dish he
had cooked, in the manner of a householder to a stranger just
come.&nbsp; The miller was anxious to know more about his
son&rsquo;s plans for the future, but would not for the present
interrupt his eating, looking up from his own plate to appreciate
Bob&rsquo;s travelled way of putting English victuals out of
sight, as he would have looked at a mill on improved
principles.</p>
<p>David had only just got the table clear, and set the plates in
a row under the bakehouse table for the cats to lick, when the
door was hastily opened, and Mrs. Garland came in, looking
concerned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been waiting to hear the plates removed to tell
you how frightened we are at something we hear at the
back-door.&nbsp; It seems like robbers muttering; but when I look
out there&rsquo;s nobody there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This must be seen to,&rsquo; said the miller, rising
promptly.&nbsp; &lsquo;David, light the middle-sized
lantern.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go and search the garden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll go too,&rsquo; said his son, taking up a
cudgel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lucky I&rsquo;ve come home just in
time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went out stealthily, followed by the widow and Anne, who
had been afraid to stay alone in the house under the
circumstances.&nbsp; No sooner were they beyond the door when,
sure enough, there was the muttering almost close at hand, and
low upon the ground, as from persons lying down in hiding.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless my heart!&rsquo; said Bob, striking his head as
though it were some enemy&rsquo;s: &lsquo;why, &rsquo;tis my
luggage.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d quite forgot it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; asked his father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My luggage.&nbsp; Really, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
Mrs. Garland it would have stayed there all night, and they, poor
things! would have been starved.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got all sorts
of articles for ye.&nbsp; You go inside, and I&rsquo;ll bring
&rsquo;em in.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis parrots that you hear a muttering,
Mrs. Garland.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t be afraid any
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Parrots?&rsquo; said the miller.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
I&rsquo;m glad &rsquo;tis no worse.&nbsp; But how couldst forget
so, Bob?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The packages were taken in by David and Bob, and the first
unfastened were three, wrapped in cloths, which being stripped
off revealed three cages, with a gorgeous parrot in each.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This one is for you, father, to hang up outside the
door, and amuse us,&rsquo; said Bob.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll
talk very well, but he&rsquo;s sleepy to-night.&nbsp; This other
one I brought along for any neighbour that would like to have
him.&nbsp; His colours are not so bright; but &rsquo;tis a good
bird.&nbsp; If you would like to have him you are welcome to
him,&rsquo; he said, turning to Anne, who had been tempted
forward by the birds.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have hardly spoken yet,
Miss Anne, but I recollect you very well.&nbsp; How much taller
you have got, to be sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne said she was much obliged, but did not know what she
could do with such a present.&nbsp; Mrs. Garland accepted it for
her, and the sailor went on&mdash;&lsquo;Now this other bird I
hardly know what to do with; but I dare say he&rsquo;ll come in
for something or other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is by far the prettiest,&rsquo; said the
widow.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would rather have it than the other, if you
don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Bob, with embarrassment.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But the fact is, that bird will hardly do for ye,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a hard swearer, to tell the truth;
and I am afraid he&rsquo;s too old to be broken of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How dreadful!&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We could keep him in the mill,&rsquo; suggested the
miller.&nbsp; &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t matter about the grinder
hearing him, for he can&rsquo;t learn to cuss worse than he do
already!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The grinder shall have him, then,&rsquo; said
Bob.&nbsp; &lsquo;The one I have given you, ma&rsquo;am, has no
harm in him at all.&nbsp; You might take him to church o&rsquo;
Sundays as far as that goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sailor now untied a small wooden box about a foot square,
perforated with holes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here are two
marmosets,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t see
them to-night; but they are beauties&mdash;the tufted
sort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s a marmoset?&rsquo; said the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, a little kind of monkey.&nbsp; They bite strangers
rather hard, but you&rsquo;ll soon get used to
&rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are wrapped up in something, I declare,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Garland, peeping in through a chink.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s my flannel shirt,&rsquo; said Bob
apologetically.&nbsp; &lsquo;They suffer terribly from cold in
this climate, poor things! and I had nothing better to give
them.&nbsp; Well, now, in this next box I&rsquo;ve got things of
different sorts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The latter was a regular seaman&rsquo;s chest, and out of it
he produced shells of many sizes and colours, carved ivories,
queer little caskets, gorgeous feathers, and several silk
handkerchiefs, which articles were spread out upon all the
available tables and chairs till the house began to look like a
bazaar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a lovely shawl!&rsquo; exclaimed Widow Garland, in
her interest forestalling the regular exhibition by looking into
the box at what was coming.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said the mate, pulling out a couple of
the most bewitching shawls that eyes ever saw.&nbsp; &lsquo;One
of these I am going to give to that young lady I am shortly to be
married to, you know, Mrs. Garland.&nbsp; Has father told you
about it?&nbsp; Matilda Johnson, of Southampton, that&rsquo;s her
name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, we know all about it,&rsquo; said the widow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I shall give one of these shawls to
her&mdash;because, of course, I ought to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the other one I&rsquo;ve got no use for at all;
and,&rsquo; he continued, looking round, &lsquo;will you have it,
Miss Anne?&nbsp; You refused the parrot, and you ought not to
refuse this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Anne calmly, but much
distressed; &lsquo;but really I don&rsquo;t want it, and
couldn&rsquo;t take it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But do have it!&rsquo; said Bob in hurt tones, Mrs.
Garland being all the while on tenter-hooks lest Anne should
persist in her absurd refusal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, there&rsquo;s another reason why you ought
to!&rsquo; said he, his face lighting up with
recollections.&nbsp; &lsquo;It never came into my head till this
moment that I used to be your beau in a humble sort of way.&nbsp;
Faith, so I did, and we used to meet at places sometimes,
didn&rsquo;t we&mdash;that is, when you were not too proud; and
once I gave you, or somebody else, a bit of my hair in
fun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was somebody else,&rsquo; said Anne quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, perhaps it was,&rsquo; said Bob innocently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But it was you I used to meet, or try to, I am sure.&nbsp;
Well, I&rsquo;ve never thought of that boyish time for years till
this minute!&nbsp; I am sure you ought to accept some one gift,
dear, out of compliment to those old times!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne drew back and shook her head, for she would not trust her
voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mrs. Garland, then you shall have it,&rsquo; said
Bob, tossing the shawl to that ready receiver.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you don&rsquo;t, upon my life I will throw it out to the first
beggar I see.&nbsp; Now, here&rsquo;s a parcel of cap ribbons of
the splendidest sort I could get.&nbsp; Have these&mdash;do,
Anne!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, do,&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I promised them to Matilda,&rsquo; continued Bob;
&lsquo;but I am sure she won&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em, as she has
got some of her own: and I would as soon see them upon your head,
my dear, as upon hers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you had better keep them for your bride if you
have promised them to her,&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland mildly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t exactly a promise.&nbsp; I just said,
&ldquo;Til, there&rsquo;s some cap ribbons in my box, if you
would like to have them.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she&rsquo;s got enough
things already for any bride in creation.&nbsp; Anne, now you
shall have &rsquo;em&mdash;upon my soul you shall&mdash;or
I&rsquo;ll fling them down the mill-tail!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne had meant to be perfectly firm in refusing everything,
for reasons obvious even to that poor waif, the meanest capacity;
but when it came to this point she was absolutely compelled to
give in, and reluctantly received the cap ribbons in her arms,
blushing fitfully, and with her lip trembling in a motion which
she tried to exhibit as a smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What would Tilly say if she knew!&rsquo; said the
miller slily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed&mdash;and it is wrong of him!&rsquo; Anne
instantly cried, tears running down her face as she threw the
parcel of ribbons on the floor.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better
bestow your gifts where you bestow your l&mdash;l&mdash;love, Mr.
Loveday&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I say!&rsquo;&nbsp; And Anne
turned her back and went away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take them for her,&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland,
quickly picking up the parcel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now that&rsquo;s a pity,&rsquo; said Bob, looking
regretfully after Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t remember that
she was a quick-tempered sort of girl at all.&nbsp; Tell her,
Mrs. Garland, that I ask her pardon.&nbsp; But of course I
didn&rsquo;t know she was too proud to accept a little
present&mdash;how should I?&nbsp; Upon my life if it wasn&rsquo;t
for Matilda I&rsquo;d&mdash;Well, that can&rsquo;t be, of
course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland, touching
with her foot a large package that had been laid down by Bob
unseen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a bit of baccy for myself,&rsquo; said
Robert meekly.</p>
<p>The examination of presents at last ended, and the two
families parted for the night.&nbsp; When they were alone, Mrs.
Garland said to Anne, &lsquo;What a close girl you are!&nbsp; I
am sure I never knew that Bob Loveday and you had walked
together: you must have been mere children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes&mdash;so we were,&rsquo; said Anne, now quite
recovered.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was when we first came here, about a
year after father died.&nbsp; We did not walk together in any
regular way.&nbsp; You know I have never thought the Lovedays
high enough for me.&nbsp; It was only just&mdash;nothing at all,
and I had almost forgotten it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that somebody&rsquo;s sins were forgiven her
that night before she went to bed.</p>
<p>When Bob and his father were left alone, the miller said,
&lsquo;Well, Robert, about this young woman of
thine&mdash;Matilda what&rsquo;s her name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, father&mdash;Matilda Johnson.&nbsp; I was just
going to tell ye about her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The miller nodded, and sipped his mug.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, she is an excellent body,&rsquo; continued Bob;
&lsquo;that can truly be said&mdash;a real charmer, you
know&mdash;a nice good comely young woman, a miracle of genteel
breeding, you know, and all that.&nbsp; She can throw her hair
into the nicest curls, and she&rsquo;s got splendid gowns and
headclothes.&nbsp; In short, you might call her a land
mermaid.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll make such a first-rate wife as there
never was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt she will,&rsquo; said the miller; &lsquo;for I
have never known thee wanting in sense in a jineral
way.&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned his cup round on its axis till the
handle had travelled a complete circle.&nbsp; &lsquo;How long did
you say in your letter that you had known her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A fortnight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not <i>very</i> long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It don&rsquo;t sound long, &rsquo;tis true; and
&rsquo;twas really longer&mdash;&rsquo;twas fifteen days and a
quarter.&nbsp; But hang it, father, I could see in the twinkling
of an eye that the girl would do.&nbsp; I know a woman well
enough when I see her&mdash;I ought to, indeed, having been so
much about the world.&nbsp; Now, for instance, there&rsquo;s
Widow Garland and her daughter.&nbsp; The girl is a nice little
thing; but the old woman&mdash;O no!&rsquo;&nbsp; Bob shook his
head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What of her?&rsquo; said his father, slightly shifting
in his chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, she&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s&mdash;I mean, I should
never have chose her, you know.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s of a nice
disposition, and young for a widow with a grown-up daughter; but
if all the men had been like me she would never have had a
husband.&nbsp; I like her in some respects; but she&rsquo;s a
style of beauty I don&rsquo;t care for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, if &rsquo;tis only looks you are thinking of,&rsquo;
said the miller, much relieved, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing to
be said, of course.&nbsp; Though there&rsquo;s many a duchess
worse-looking, if it comes to argument, as you would find, my
son,&rsquo; he added, with a sense of having been mollified too
soon.</p>
<p>The mate&rsquo;s thoughts were elsewhere by this time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to my marrying Matilda, thinks I, here&rsquo;s one
of the very genteelest sort, and I may as well do the job at
once.&nbsp; So I chose her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a dear girl;
there&rsquo;s nobody like her, search where you will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many did you choose her out from?&rsquo; inquired
his father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, she was the only young woman I happened to know
in Southampton, that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; But what of that?&nbsp;
It would have been all the same if I had known a
hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her father is in business near the docks, I
suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no.&nbsp; In short, I didn&rsquo;t see her
father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her mother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her mother?&nbsp; No, I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I think her
mother is dead; but she has got a very rich aunt living at
Melchester.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t see her aunt, because there
wasn&rsquo;t time to go; but of course we shall know her when we
are married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, of course,&rsquo; said the miller, trying to
feel quite satisfied.&nbsp; &lsquo;And she will soon be
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, she&rsquo;s coming soon,&rsquo; said Bob.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She has gone to this aunt&rsquo;s at Melchester to get her
things packed, and suchlike, or she would have come with
me.&nbsp; I am going to meet the coach at the King&rsquo;s Arms,
Casterbridge, on Sunday, at one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; To show what
a capital sort of wife she&rsquo;ll be, I may tell you that she
wanted to come by the Mercury, because &rsquo;tis a little
cheaper than the other.&nbsp; But I said, &ldquo;For once in your
life do it well, and come by the Royal Mail, and I&rsquo;ll
pay.&rdquo;&nbsp; I can have the pony and trap to fetch her, I
suppose, as &rsquo;tis too far for her to walk?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you can, Bob, or anything else.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;ll do all I can to give you a good wedding
feast.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>XVI.&nbsp; THEY MAKE READY FOR THE ILLUSTRIOUS STRANGER</h2>
<p>Preparations for Matilda&rsquo;s welcome, and for the event
which was to follow, at once occupied the attention of the
mill.&nbsp; The miller and his man had but dim notions of
housewifery on any large scale; so the great wedding cleaning was
kindly supervised by Mrs. Garland, Bob being mostly away during
the day with his brother, the trumpet-major, on various errands,
one of which was to buy paint and varnish for the gig that
Matilda was to be fetched in, which he had determined to decorate
with his own hands.</p>
<p>By the widow&rsquo;s direction the old familiar incrustation
of shining dirt, imprinted along the back of the settle by the
heads of countless jolly sitters, was scrubbed and scraped away;
the brown circle round the nail whereon the miller hung his hat,
stained by the brim in wet weather, was whitened over; the tawny
smudges of bygone shoulders in the passage were removed without
regard to a certain genial and historical value which they had
acquired.&nbsp; The face of the clock, coated with verdigris as
thick as a diachylon plaister, was rubbed till the figures
emerged into day; while, inside the case of the same chronometer,
the cobwebs that formed triangular hammocks, which the pendulum
could hardly wade through, were cleared away at one swoop.</p>
<p>Mrs. Garland also assisted at the invasion of worm-eaten
cupboards, where layers of ancient smells lingered on in the
stagnant air, and recalled to the reflective nose the many good
things that had been kept there.&nbsp; The upper floors were
scrubbed with such abundance of water that the old-established
death-watches, wood-lice, and flour-worms were all drowned, the
suds trickling down into the room below in so lively and novel a
manner as to convey the romantic notion that the miller lived in
a cave with dripping stalactites.</p>
<p>They moved what had never been moved before&mdash;the oak
coffer, containing the miller&rsquo;s wardrobe&mdash;a tremendous
weight, what with its locks, hinges, nails, dirt, framework, and
the hard stratification of old jackets, waistcoats, and
knee-breeches at the bottom, never disturbed since the
miller&rsquo;s wife died, and half pulverized by the moths, whose
flattened skeletons lay amid the mass in thousands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It fairly makes my back open and shut!&rsquo; said
Loveday, as, in obedience to Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s direction, he
lifted one corner, the grinder and David assisting at the
others.&nbsp; &lsquo;All together: speak when ye be going to
heave.&nbsp; Now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The pot covers and skimmers were brought to such a state that,
on examining them, the beholder was not conscious of utensils,
but of his own face in a condition of hideous elasticity.&nbsp;
The broken clock-line was mended, the kettles rocked, the creeper
nailed up, and a new handle put to the warming-pan.&nbsp; The
large household lantern was cleaned out, after three years of
uninterrupted accumulation, the operation yielding a conglomerate
of candle-snuffs, candle-ends, remains of matches, lamp-black,
and eleven ounces and a half of good grease&mdash;invaluable as
dubbing for skitty boots and ointment for cart-wheels.</p>
<p>Everybody said that the mill residence had not been so
thoroughly scoured for twenty years.&nbsp; The miller and David
looked on with a sort of awe tempered by gratitude, tacitly
admitting by their gaze that this was beyond what they had ever
thought of.&nbsp; Mrs. Garland supervised all with disinterested
benevolence.&nbsp; It would never have done, she said, for his
future daughter-in-law to see the house in its original
state.&nbsp; She would have taken a dislike to him, and perhaps
to Bob likewise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t ye come and live here with me, and then
you would be able to see to it at all times?&rsquo; said the
miller as she bustled about again.&nbsp; To which she answered
that she was considering the matter, and might in good
time.&nbsp; He had previously informed her that his plan was to
put Bob and his wife in the part of the house that she, Mrs.
Garland, occupied, as soon as she chose to enter his, which
relieved her of any fear of being incommoded by Matilda.</p>
<p>The cooking for the wedding festivities was on a proportionate
scale of thoroughness.&nbsp; They killed the four supernumerary
chickens that had just begun to crow, and the little curly-tailed
barrow pig, in preference to the sow; not having been put up
fattening for more than five weeks it was excellent small meat,
and therefore more delicate and likely to suit a town-bred
lady&rsquo;s taste than the large one, which, having reached the
weight of fourteen score, might have been a little gross to a
cultured palate.&nbsp; There were also provided a cold chine,
stuffed veal, and two pigeon pies.&nbsp; Also thirty rings of
black-pot, a dozen of white-pot, and ten knots of tender and
well-washed chitterlings, cooked plain in case she should like a
change.</p>
<p>As additional reserves there were sweetbreads, and five milts,
sewed up at one side in the form of a chrysalis, and stuffed with
thyme, sage, parsley, mint, groats, rice, milk, chopped egg, and
other ingredients.&nbsp; They were afterwards roasted before a
slow fire, and eaten hot.</p>
<p>The business of chopping so many herbs for the various
stuffings was found to be aching work for women; and David, the
miller, the grinder, and the grinder&rsquo;s boy being fully
occupied in their proper branches, and Bob being very busy
painting the gig and touching up the harness, Loveday called in a
friendly dragoon of John&rsquo;s regiment who was passing by, and
he, being a muscular man, willingly chopped all the afternoon for
a quart of strong, judiciously administered, and all other
victuals found, taking off his jacket and gloves, rolling up his
shirt-sleeves and unfastening his collar in an honourable and
energetic way.</p>
<p>All windfalls and maggot-cored codlins were excluded from the
apple pies; and as there was no known dish large enough for the
purpose, the puddings were stirred up in the milking-pail, and
boiled in the three-legged bell-metal crock, of great weight and
antiquity, which every travelling tinker for the previous thirty
years had tapped with his stick, coveted, made a bid for, and
often attempted to steal.</p>
<p>In the liquor line Loveday laid in an ample barrel of
Casterbridge &lsquo;strong beer.&rsquo;&nbsp; This renowned
drink&mdash;now almost as much a thing of the past as
Falstaff&rsquo;s favourite beverage&mdash;was not only well
calculated to win the hearts of soldiers blown dry and dusty by
residence in tents on a hill-top, but of any wayfarer whatever in
that land.&nbsp; It was of the most beautiful colour that the eye
of an artist in beer could desire; full in body, yet brisk as a
volcano; piquant, yet without a twang; luminous as an autumn
sunset; free from streakiness of taste; but, finally, rather
heady.&nbsp; The masses worshipped it, the minor gentry loved it
more than wine, and by the most illustrious county families it
was not despised.&nbsp; Anybody brought up for being drunk and
disorderly in the streets of its natal borough, had only to prove
that he was a stranger to the place and its liquor to be
honourably dismissed by the magistrates, as one overtaken in a
fault that no man could guard against who entered the town
unawares.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Loveday also tapped a hogshead of fine cider
that he had had mellowing in the house for several months, having
bought it of an honest down-country man, who did not colour, for
any special occasion like the present.&nbsp; It had been pressed
from fruit judiciously chosen by an old hand&mdash;Horner and
Cleeves apple for the body, a few Tom-Putts for colour, and just
a dash of Old Five-corners for sparkle&mdash;a selection
originally made to please the palate of a well-known temperate
earl who was a regular cider-drinker, and lived to be
eighty-eight.</p>
<p>On the morning of the Sunday appointed for her coming Captain
Bob Loveday set out to meet his bride.&nbsp; He had been all the
week engaged in painting the gig, assisted by his brother at odd
times, and it now appeared of a gorgeous yellow, with blue
streaks, and tassels at the corners, and red wheels outlined with
a darker shade.&nbsp; He put in the pony at half-past eleven,
Anne looking at him from the door as he packed himself into the
vehicle and drove off.&nbsp; There may be young women who look
out at young men driving to meet their brides as Anne looked at
Captain Bob, and yet are quite indifferent to the circumstances;
but they are not often met with.</p>
<p>So much dust had been raised on the highway by traffic
resulting from the presence of the Court at the town further on,
that brambles hanging from the fence, and giving a friendly
scratch to the wanderer&rsquo;s face, were dingy as church
cobwebs; and the grass on the margin had assumed a paper-shaving
hue.&nbsp; Bob&rsquo;s father had wished him to take David, lest,
from want of recent experience at the whip, he should meet with
any mishap; but, picturing to himself the awkwardness of three in
such circumstances, Bob would not hear of this; and nothing more
serious happened to his driving than that the wheel-marks formed
two serpentine lines along the road during the first mile or two,
before he had got his hand in, and that the horse shied at a
milestone, a piece of paper, a sleeping tramp, and a wheelbarrow,
just to make use of the opportunity of being in bad hands.</p>
<p>He entered Casterbridge between twelve and one, and, putting
up at the Old Greyhound, walked on to the Bow.&nbsp; Here, rather
dusty on the ledges of his clothes, he stood and waited while the
people in their best summer dresses poured out of the three
churches round him.&nbsp; When they had all gone, and a smell of
cinders and gravy had spread down the ancient high-street, and
the pie-dishes from adjacent bakehouses had all travelled past,
he saw the mail coach rise above the arch of Grey&rsquo;s Bridge,
a quarter of a mile distant, surmounted by swaying knobs, which
proved to be the heads of the outside travellers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the way for a man&rsquo;s bride to come to
him,&rsquo; said Robert to himself with a feeling of poetry; and
as the horn sounded and the horses clattered up the street he
walked down to the inn.&nbsp; The knot of hostlers and
inn-servants had gathered, the horses were dragged from the
vehicle, and the passengers for Casterbridge began to
descend.&nbsp; Captain Bob eyed them over, looked inside, looked
outside again; to his disappointment Matilda was not there, nor
her boxes, nor anything that was hers.&nbsp; Neither coachman nor
guard had seen or heard of such a person at Melchester; and Bob
walked slowly away.</p>
<p>Depressed by forebodings to an extent which took away nearly a
third of his appetite, he sat down in the parlour of the Old
Greyhound to a slice from the family joint of the landlord.&nbsp;
This gentleman, who dined in his shirt-sleeves, partly because it
was August, and partly from a sense that they would not be so fit
for public view further on in the week, suggested that Bob should
wait till three or four that afternoon, when the road-waggon
would arrive, as the lost lady might have preferred that mode of
conveyance; and when Bob appeared rather hurt at the suggestion,
the landlord&rsquo;s wife assured him, as a woman who knew good
life, that many genteel persons travelled in that way during the
present high price of provisions.&nbsp; Loveday, who knew little
of travelling by land, readily accepted her assurance and
resolved to wait.</p>
<p>Wandering up and down the pavement, or leaning against some
hot wall between the waggon-office and the corner of the street
above, he passed the time away.&nbsp; It was a still, sunny,
drowsy afternoon, and scarcely a soul was visible in the length
and breadth of the street.&nbsp; The office was not far from All
Saints&rsquo; Church, and the church-windows being open, he could
hear the afternoon service from where he lingered as distinctly
as if he had been one of the congregation.&nbsp; Thus he was
mentally conducted through the Psalms, through the first and
second lessons, through the burst of fiddles and clarionets which
announced the evening-hymn, and well into the sermon, before any
signs of the waggon could be seen upon the London road.</p>
<p>The afternoon sermons at this church being of a dry and
metaphysical nature at that date, it was by a special providence
that the waggon-office was placed near the ancient fabric, so
that whenever the Sunday waggon was late, which it always was in
hot weather, in cold weather, in wet weather, and in weather of
almost every other sort, the rattle, dismounting, and swearing
outside completely drowned the parson&rsquo;s voice within, and
sustained the flagging interest of the congregation at precisely
the right moment.&nbsp; No sooner did the charity children begin
to writhe on their benches, and adult snores grow audible, than
the waggon arrived.</p>
<p>Captain Loveday felt a kind of sinking in his poetry at the
possibility of her for whom they had made such preparations being
in the slow, unwieldy vehicle which crunched its way towards him;
but he would not give in to the weakness.&nbsp; Neither would he
walk down the street to meet the waggon, lest she should not be
there.&nbsp; At last the broad wheels drew up against the kerb,
the waggoner with his white smock-frock, and whip as long as a
fishing-line, descended from the pony on which he rode alongside,
and the six broad-chested horses backed from their collars and
shook themselves.&nbsp; In another moment something showed forth,
and he knew that Matilda was there.</p>
<p>Bob felt three cheers rise within him as she stepped down; but
it being Sunday he did not utter them.&nbsp; In dress, Miss
Johnson passed his expectations&mdash;a green and white gown,
with long, tight sleeves, a green silk handkerchief round her
neck and crossed in front, a green parasol, and green
gloves.&nbsp; It was strange enough to see this verdant
caterpillar turn out of a road-waggon, and gracefully shake
herself free from the bits of straw and fluff which would usually
gather on the raiment of the grandest travellers by that
vehicle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear Matilda,&rsquo; said Bob, when he had
kissed her three times with much publicity&mdash;the practical
step he had determined on seeming to demand that these things
should no longer be done in a corner&mdash;&lsquo;my dear
Matilda, why didn&rsquo;t you come by the coach, having the money
for&rsquo;t and all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s my scrimping!&rsquo; said Matilda in a
delightful gush.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know you won&rsquo;t be offended
when you know I did it to save against a rainy day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob, of course, was not offended, though the glory of meeting
her had been less; and even if vexation were possible, it would
have been out of place to say so.&nbsp; Still, he would have
experienced no little surprise had he learnt the real reason of
his Matilda&rsquo;s change of plan.&nbsp; That angel had, in
short, so wildly spent Bob&rsquo;s and her own money in the
adornment of her person before setting out, that she found
herself without a sufficient margin for her fare by coach, and
had scrimped from sheer necessity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I have got the trap out at the Greyhound,&rsquo;
said Bob.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it will hold
your luggage and us too; but it looked more respectable than the
waggon on a Sunday, and if there&rsquo;s not room for the boxes I
can walk alongside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think there will be room,&rsquo; said Miss Johnson
mildly.&nbsp; And it was soon very evident that she spoke the
truth; for when her property was deposited on the pavement, it
consisted of a trunk about eighteen inches long, and nothing
more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&rsquo; said Captain Loveday,
surprised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said the young woman
assuringly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to give trouble, you
know, and what I have besides I have left at my
aunt&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, of course,&rsquo; he answered readily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And as it&rsquo;s no bigger, I can carry it in my hand to
the inn, and so it will be no trouble at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He caught up the little box, and they went side by side to the
Greyhound; and in ten minutes they were trotting up the Southern
Road.</p>
<p>Bob did not hurry the horse, there being many things to say
and hear, for which the present situation was admirably
suited.&nbsp; The sun shone occasionally into Matilda&rsquo;s
face as they drove on, its rays picking out all her features to a
great nicety.&nbsp; Her eyes would have been called brown, but
they were really eel-colour, like many other nice brown eyes;
they were well-shaped and rather bright, though they had more of
a broad shine than a sparkle.&nbsp; She had a firm, sufficient
nose, which seemed to say of itself that it was good as noses
go.&nbsp; She had rather a picturesque way of wrapping her upper
in her lower lip, so that the red of the latter showed
strongly.&nbsp; Whenever she gazed against the sun towards the
distant hills, she brought into her forehead, without knowing it,
three short vertical lines&mdash;not there at other
times&mdash;giving her for the moment rather a hard look.&nbsp;
And in turning her head round to a far angle, to stare at
something or other that he pointed out, the drawn flesh of her
neck became a mass of lines.&nbsp; But Bob did not look at these
things, which, of course, were of no significance; for had she
not told him, when they compared ages, that she was a little over
two-and-twenty?</p>
<p>As Nature was hardly invented at this early point of the
century, Bob&rsquo;s Matilda could not say much about the glamour
of the hills, or the shimmering of the foliage, or the wealth of
glory in the distant sea, as she would doubtless have done had
she lived later on; but she did her best to be interesting,
asking Bob about matters of social interest in the neighbourhood,
to which she seemed quite a stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is your watering-place a large city?&rsquo; she
inquired when they mounted the hill where the Overcombe folk had
waited for the King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless you, my dear&mdash;no!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be
nothing if it wasn&rsquo;t for the Royal Family, and the lords
and ladies, and the regiments of soldiers, and the frigates, and
the King&rsquo;s messengers, and the actors and actresses, and
the games that go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the words &lsquo;actors and actresses,&rsquo; the innocent
young thing pricked up her ears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does Elliston pay as good salaries this summer as
in&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, you know about it then?&nbsp; I
thought&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no!&nbsp; I have heard of Budmouth&mdash;read in
the papers, you know, dear Robert, about the doings there, and
the actors and actresses, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, I see.&nbsp; Well, I have been away from
England a long time, and don&rsquo;t know much about the theatre
in the town; but I&rsquo;ll take you there some day.&nbsp; Would
it be a treat to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, an amazing treat!&rsquo; said Miss Johnson, with an
ecstasy in which a close observer might have discovered a tinge
of ghastliness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve never been into one perhaps,
dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;N&mdash;never,&rsquo; said Matilda flatly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Whatever do I see yonder&mdash;a row of white things on
the down?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a part of the encampment above
Overcombe.&nbsp; Lots of soldiers are encamped about here; those
are the white tops of their tents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a wing of the camp that had become
visible.&nbsp; Matilda was much interested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will make it very lively for us,&rsquo; he added,
&lsquo;especially as John is there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She thought so too, and thus they chatted on.</p>
<h2>XVII.&nbsp; TWO FAINTING FITS AND A BEWILDERMENT</h2>
<p>Meanwhile Miller Loveday was expecting the pair with interest;
and about five o&rsquo;clock, after repeated outlooks, he saw two
specks the size of caraway seeds on the far line of ridge where
the sunlit white of the road met the blue of the sky.&nbsp; Then
the remainder parts of Bob and his lady became visible, and then
the whole vehicle, end on, and he heard the dry rattle of the
wheels on the dusty road.&nbsp; Miller Loveday&rsquo;s plan, as
far as he had formed any, was that Robert and his wife should
live with him in the millhouse until Mrs. Garland made up her
mind to join him there; in which event her present house would be
made over to the young couple.&nbsp; Upon all grounds, he wished
to welcome becomingly the woman of his son&rsquo;s choice, and
came forward promptly as they drew up at the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a lovely place you&rsquo;ve got here!&rsquo; said
Miss Johnson, when the miller had received her from the
captain.&nbsp; &lsquo;A real stream of water, a real mill-wheel,
and real fowls, and everything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, &rsquo;tis real enough,&rsquo; said Loveday,
looking at the river with balanced sentiments; &lsquo;and so you
will say when you&rsquo;ve lived here a bit as mis&rsquo;ess, and
had the trouble of claning the furniture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this Miss Johnson looked modest, and continued to do so
till Anne, not knowing they were there, came round the corner of
the house, with her prayer-book in her hand, having just arrived
from church.&nbsp; Bob turned and smiled to her, at which Miss
Johnson looked glum.&nbsp; How long she would have remained in
that phase is unknown, for just then her ears were assailed by a
loud bass note from the other side, causing her to jump
round.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O la! what dreadful thing is it?&rsquo; she exclaimed,
and beheld a cow of Loveday&rsquo;s, of the name of Crumpler,
standing close to her shoulder.&nbsp; It being about
milking-time, she had come to look up David and hasten on the
operation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, what a horrid bull!&mdash;it did frighten me
so.&nbsp; I hope I shan&rsquo;t faint,&rsquo; said Matilda.</p>
<p>The miller immediately used the formula which has been uttered
by the proprietors of live stock ever since Noah&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; &lsquo;She won&rsquo;t hurt ye.&nbsp; Hoosh,
Crumpler!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s as timid as a mouse,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But as Crumpler persisted in making another terrific inquiry
for David, Matilda could not help closing her eyes and saying,
&lsquo;O, I shall be gored to death!&rsquo; her head falling back
upon Bob&rsquo;s shoulder, which&mdash;seeing the urgent
circumstances, and knowing her delicate nature&mdash;he had
providentially placed in a position to catch her.&nbsp; Anne
Garland, who had been standing at the corner of the house, not
knowing whether to go back or come on, at this felt her womanly
sympathies aroused.&nbsp; She ran and dipped her handkerchief
into the splashing mill-tail, and with it damped Matilda&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; But as her eyes still remained closed, Bob, to
increase the effect, took the handkerchief from Anne and wrung it
out on the bridge of Matilda&rsquo;s nose, whence it ran over the
rest of her face in a stream.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Captain Loveday!&rsquo; said Anne, &lsquo;the water
is running over her green silk handkerchief, and into her pretty
reticule!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&mdash;if I didn&rsquo;t think so!&rsquo;
exclaimed Matilda, opening her eyes, starting up, and promptly
pulling out her own handkerchief, with which she wiped away the
drops, and an unimportant trifle of her complexion, assisted by
Anne, who, in spite of her background of antagonistic emotions,
could not help being interested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; said the miller, his spirits
reviving with the revival of Matilda.&nbsp; &lsquo;The lady is
not used to country life; are you, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not,&rsquo; replied the sufferer.&nbsp; &lsquo;All
is so strange about here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly there spread into the firmament, from the direction
of the down:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ra, ta, ta!&nbsp; Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!&nbsp; Ra,
ta, ta!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;O dear, dear! more hideous country sounds, I
suppose?&rsquo; she inquired, with another start.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no,&rsquo; said the miller cheerfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis only my son John&rsquo;s trumpeter chaps at the
camp of dragoons just above us, a-blowing Mess, or Feed, or
Picket, or some other of their vagaries.&nbsp; John will be much
pleased to tell you the meaning on&rsquo;t when he comes
down.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s trumpet-major, as you may know,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes; you mean Captain Loveday&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp;
Dear Bob has mentioned him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you come round to Widow Garland&rsquo;s side of the
house, you can see the camp,&rsquo; said the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t force her; she&rsquo;s tired with her long
journey,&rsquo; said Mrs. Garland humanely, the widow having come
out in the general wish to see Captain Bob&rsquo;s choice.&nbsp;
Indeed, they all behaved towards her as if she were a tender
exotic, which their crude country manners might seriously
injure.</p>
<p>She went into the house, accompanied by Mrs. Garland and her
daughter; though before leaving Bob she managed to whisper in his
ear, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell them I came by waggon, will you,
dear?&rsquo;&mdash;a request which was quite needless, for Bob
had long ago determined to keep that a dead secret; not because
it was an uncommon mode of travel, but simply that it was hardly
the usual conveyance for a gorgeous lady to her bridal.</p>
<p>As the men had a feeling that they would be superfluous
indoors just at present, the miller assisted David in taking the
horse round to the stables, Bob following, and leaving Matilda to
the women.&nbsp; Indoors, Miss Johnson admired everything: the
new parrots and marmosets, the black beams of the ceiling, the
double-corner cupboard with the glass doors, through which
gleamed the remainders of sundry china sets acquired by
Bob&rsquo;s mother in her housekeeping&mdash;two-handled
sugar-basins, no-handled tea-cups, a tea-pot like a pagoda, and a
cream-jug in the form of a spotted cow.&nbsp; This sociability in
their visitor was returned by Mrs. Garland and Anne; and Miss
Johnson&rsquo;s pleasing habit of partly dying whenever she heard
any unusual bark or bellow added to her piquancy in their
eyes.&nbsp; But conversation, as such, was naturally at first of
a nervous, tentative kind, in which, as in the works of some
minor poets, the sense was considerably led by the sound.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You get the sea-breezes here, no doubt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, dear; when the wind is that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you like windy weather?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; though not now, for it blows down the young
apples.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Apples are plentiful, it seems.&nbsp; You country-folk
call St. Swithin&rsquo;s their christening day, if it
rains?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear.&nbsp; Ah me! I have not been to a
christening for these many years; the baby&rsquo;s name was
George, I remember&mdash;after the King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hear that King George is still staying at the town
here.&nbsp; I <i>hope</i> he&rsquo;ll stay till I have seen
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll wait till the corn turns yellow; he always
does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How <i>very</i> fashionable yellow is getting for
gloves just now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Some persons wear them to the elbow, I
hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do they?&nbsp; I was not aware of that.&nbsp; I struck
my elbow last week so hard against the door of my aunt&rsquo;s
mansion that I feel the ache now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before they were quite overwhelmed by the interest of this
discourse, the miller and Bob came in.&nbsp; In truth, Mrs.
Garland found the office in which he had placed her&mdash;that of
introducing a strange woman to a house which was not the
widow&rsquo;s own&mdash;a rather awkward one, and yet almost a
necessity.&nbsp; There was no woman belonging to the house except
that wondrous compendium of usefulness, the intermittent
maid-servant, whom Loveday had, for appearances, borrowed from
Mrs. Garland, and Mrs. Garland was in the habit of borrowing from
the girl&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; And as for the demi-woman David,
he had been informed as peremptorily as Pharaoh&rsquo;s baker
that the office of housemaid and bedmaker was taken from him, and
would be given to this girl till the wedding was over, and
Bob&rsquo;s wife took the management into her own hands.</p>
<p>They all sat down to high tea, Anne and her mother included,
and the captain sitting next to Miss Johnson.&nbsp; Anne had put
a brave face upon the matter&mdash;outwardly, at least&mdash;and
seemed in a fair way of subduing any lingering sentiment which
Bob&rsquo;s return had revived.&nbsp; During the evening, and
while they still sat over the meal, John came down on a hurried
visit, as he had promised, ostensibly on purpose to be introduced
to his intended sister-in-law, but much more to get a word and a
smile from his beloved Anne.&nbsp; Before they saw him, they
heard the trumpet-major&rsquo;s smart step coming round the
corner of the house, and in a moment his form darkened the
door.&nbsp; As it was Sunday, he appeared in his full-dress laced
coat, white waistcoat and breeches, and towering plume, the
latter of which he instantly lowered, as much from necessity as
good manners, the beam in the mill-house ceiling having a
tendency to smash and ruin all such head-gear without
warning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;John, we&rsquo;ve been hoping you would come
down,&rsquo; said the miller, &lsquo;and so we have kept the tay
about on purpose.&nbsp; Draw up, and speak to Mrs. Matilda
Johnson. . . . Ma&rsquo;am, this is Robert&rsquo;s
brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your humble servant, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the
trumpet-major gallantly.</p>
<p>As it was getting dusk in the low, small-paned room, he
instinctively moved towards Miss Johnson as he spoke, who sat
with her back to the window.&nbsp; He had no sooner noticed her
features than his helmet nearly fell from his hand; his face
became suddenly fixed, and his natural complexion took itself
off, leaving a greenish yellow in its stead.&nbsp; The young
person, on her part, had no sooner looked closely at him than she
said weakly, &lsquo;Robert&rsquo;s brother!&rsquo; and changed
colour yet more rapidly than the soldier had done.&nbsp; The
faintness, previously half counterfeit, seized on her now in real
earnest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel well,&rsquo; she said, suddenly
rising by an effort.&nbsp; &lsquo;This warm day has quite upset
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a regular collapse of the tea-party, like that of
the Hamlet play scene.&nbsp; Bob seized his sweetheart and
carried her upstairs, the miller exclaiming, &lsquo;Ah,
she&rsquo;s terribly worn by the journey!&nbsp; I thought she was
when I saw her nearly go off at the blare of the cow.&nbsp; No
woman would have been frightened at that if she&rsquo;d been up
to her natural strength.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That, and being so very shy of men, too, must have made
John&rsquo;s handsome regimentals quite overpowering to her, poor
thing,&rsquo; added Mrs. Garland, following the catastrophic
young lady upstairs, whose indisposition was this time beyond
question.&nbsp; And yet, by some perversity of the heart, she was
as eager now to make light of her faintness as she had been to
make much of it two or three hours ago.</p>
<p>The miller and John stood like straight sticks in the room the
others had quitted, John&rsquo;s face being hastily turned
towards a caricature of Buonaparte on the wall that he had not
seen more than a hundred and fifty times before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, sit down and have a dish of tea, anyhow,&rsquo;
said his father at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll soon be right
again, no doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks; I don&rsquo;t want any tea,&rsquo; said John
quickly.&nbsp; And, indeed, he did not, for he was in one
gigantic ache from head to foot.</p>
<p>The light had been too dim for anybody to notice his
amazement; and not knowing where to vent it, the trumpet-major
said he was going out for a minute.&nbsp; He hastened to the
bakehouse; but David being there, he went to the pantry; but the
maid being there, he went to the cart-shed; but a couple of
tramps being there, he went behind a row of French beans in the
garden, where he let off an ejaculation the most pious that he
had uttered that Sabbath day: &lsquo;Heaven! what&rsquo;s to be
done!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then he walked wildly about the paths of the dusky garden,
where the trickling of the brooks seemed loud by comparison with
the stillness around; treading recklessly on the cracking snails
that had come forth to feed, and entangling his spurs in the long
grass till the rowels were choked with its blades.&nbsp;
Presently he heard another person approaching, and his
brother&rsquo;s shape appeared between the stubbard tree and the
hedge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, is it you?&rsquo; said the mate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I am&mdash;taking a little air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is getting round nicely again; and as I am not
wanted indoors just now, I am going into the village to call upon
a friend or two I have not been able to speak to as
yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John took his brother Bob&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Bob rather
wondered why.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, old boy,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Going
into the village?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be back again, I suppose,
before it gets very late?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said Captain Bob cheerfully, and passed
out of the garden.</p>
<p>John allowed his eyes to follow his brother till his shape
could not be seen, and then he turned and again walked up and
down.</p>
<h2>XVIII.&nbsp; THE NIGHT AFTER THE ARRIVAL</h2>
<p>John continued his sad and heavy pace till walking seemed too
old and worn-out a way of showing sorrow so new, and he leant
himself against the fork of an apple-tree like a log.&nbsp; There
the trumpet-major remained for a considerable time, his face
turned towards the house, whose ancient, many-chimneyed outline
rose against the darkened sky, and just shut out from his view
the camp above.&nbsp; But faint noises coming thence from horses
restless at the pickets, and from visitors taking their leave,
recalled its existence, and reminded him that, in consequence of
Matilda&rsquo;s arrival, he had obtained leave for the
night&mdash;a fact which, owing to the startling emotions that
followed his entry, he had not yet mentioned to his friends.</p>
<p>While abstractedly considering how he could best use that
privilege under the new circumstances which had arisen, he heard
Farmer Derriman drive up to the front door and hold a
conversation with his father.&nbsp; The old man had at last
apparently brought the tin box of private papers that he wished
the miller to take charge of during Derriman&rsquo;s absence; and
it being a calm night, John could hear, though he little heeded,
Uncle Benjy&rsquo;s reiterated supplications to Loveday to keep
it safe from fire and thieves.&nbsp; Then Uncle Benjy left, and
John&rsquo;s father went upstairs to deposit the box in a place
of security, the whole proceeding reaching John&rsquo;s
preoccupied comprehension merely as voices during sleep.</p>
<p>The next thing was the appearance of a light in the bedroom
which had been assigned to Matilda Johnson.&nbsp; This
effectually aroused the trumpet-major, and with a stealthiness
unusual in him he went indoors.&nbsp; No light was in the lower
rooms, his father, Mrs. Garland, and Anne having gone out on the
bridge to look at the new moon.&nbsp; John went upstairs on
tip-toe, and along the uneven passage till he came to her
door.&nbsp; It was standing ajar, a band of candlelight shining
across the passage and up the opposite wall.&nbsp; As soon as he
entered the radiance he saw her.&nbsp; She was standing before
the looking-glass, apparently lost in thought, her fingers being
clasped behind her head in abstraction, and the light falling
full upon her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must speak to you,&rsquo; said the trumpet-major.</p>
<p>She started, turned and grew paler than before; and then, as
if moved by a sudden impulse, she swung the door wide open, and,
coming out, said quite collectedly and with apparent
pleasantness, &lsquo;O yes; you are my Bob&rsquo;s brother!&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t, for a moment, recognize you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you do now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As Bob&rsquo;s brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have not seen me before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not,&rsquo; she answered, with a face as
impassible as Talleyrand&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not!&rsquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor any of the --th Dragoons?&nbsp; Captain Jolly, for
instance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mistake.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll remind you of
particulars,&rsquo; he said drily.&nbsp; And he did remind her at
some length.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; she said desperately.</p>
<p>But she had miscalculated her staying powers, and her
adversary&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; Five minutes after that she
was in tears, and the conversation had resolved itself into
words, which, on the soldier&rsquo;s part, were of the nature of
commands, tempered by pity, and were a mere series of entreaties
on hers.</p>
<p>The whole scene did not last ten minutes.&nbsp; When it was
over, the trumpet-major walked from the doorway where they had
been standing, and brushed moisture from his eyes.&nbsp; Reaching
a dark lumber-room, he stood still there to calm himself, and
then descended by a Flemish-ladder to the bakehouse, instead of
by the front stairs.&nbsp; He found that the others, including
Bob, had gathered in the parlour during his absence and lighted
the candles.</p>
<p>Miss Johnson, having sent down some time before John
re-entered the house to say that she would prefer to keep her
room that evening, was not expected to join them, and on this
account Bob showed less than his customary liveliness.&nbsp; The
miller wishing to keep up his son&rsquo;s spirits, expressed his
regret that, it being Sunday night, they could have no songs to
make the evening cheerful; when Mrs. Garland proposed that they
should sing psalms which, by choosing lively tunes and not
thinking of the words, would be almost as good as ballads.</p>
<p>This they did, the trumpet-major appearing to join in with the
rest; but as a matter of fact no sound came from his moving
lips.&nbsp; His mind was in such a state that he derived no
pleasure even from Anne Garland&rsquo;s presence, though he held
a corner of the same book with her, and was treated in a winsome
way which it was not her usual practice to indulge in.&nbsp; She
saw that his mind was clouded, and, far from guessing the reason
why, was doing her best to clear it.</p>
<p>At length the Garlands found that it was the hour for them to
leave, and John Loveday at the same time wished his father and
Bob good-night, and went as far as Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s door with
her.</p>
<p>He had said not a word to show that he was free to remain out
of camp, for the reason that there was painful work to be done,
which it would be best to do in secret and alone.&nbsp; He
lingered near the house till its reflected window-lights ceased
to glimmer upon the mill-pond, and all within the dwelling was
dark and still.&nbsp; Then he entered the garden and waited there
till the back door opened, and a woman&rsquo;s figure timorously
came forward.&nbsp; John Loveday at once went up to her, and they
began to talk in low yet dissentient tones.</p>
<p>They had conversed about ten minutes, and were parting as if
they had come to some painful arrangement, Miss Johnson sobbing
bitterly, when a head stealthily arose above the dense hedgerow,
and in a moment a shout burst from its owner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thieves! thieves!&mdash;my tin box!&mdash;thieves!
thieves!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Matilda vanished into the house, and John Loveday hastened to
the hedge.&nbsp; &lsquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, hold your
tongue, Mr. Derriman!&rsquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My tin box!&rsquo; said Uncle Benjy.&nbsp; &lsquo;O,
only the trumpet-major!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your box is safe enough, I assure you.&nbsp; It was
only&rsquo;&mdash;here the trumpet-major gave vent to an
artificial laugh&mdash;&lsquo;only a sly bit of courting, you
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, ha, I see!&rsquo; said the relieved old
squireen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Courting Miss Anne!&nbsp; Then
you&rsquo;ve ousted my nephew, trumpet-major!&nbsp; Well, so much
the better.&nbsp; As for myself, the truth on&rsquo;t is that I
haven&rsquo;t been able to go to bed easy, for thinking that
possibly your father might not take care of what I put under his
charge; and at last I thought I would just step over and see if
all was safe here before I turned in.&nbsp; And when I saw your
two shapes my poor nerves magnified ye to housebreakers, and
Boneys, and I don&rsquo;t know what all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have alarmed the house,&rsquo; said the
trumpet-major, hearing the clicking of flint and steel in his
father&rsquo;s bedroom, followed in a moment by the rise of a
light in the window of the same apartment.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
got me into difficulty,&rsquo; he added gloomily, as his father
opened the casement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry for that,&rsquo; said Uncle Benjy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But step back; I&rsquo;ll put it all right
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, is the matter?&rsquo;
said the miller, his tasselled nightcap appearing in the
opening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, nothing!&rsquo; said the farmer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was uneasy about my few bonds and documents, and I
walked this way, miller, before going to bed, as I start from
home to-morrow morning.&nbsp; When I came down by your
garden-hedge, I thought I saw thieves, but it turned out to
be&mdash;to be&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here a lump of earth from the trumpet-major&rsquo;s hand
struck Uncle Benjy in the back as a reminder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be&mdash;the bough of a cherry-tree a-waving in the
wind.&nbsp; Good-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No thieves are like to try my house,&rsquo; said Miller
Loveday.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t you come alarming us like
this again, farmer, or you shall keep your box yourself, begging
your pardon for saying so.&nbsp; Good-night t&rsquo;
ye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miller, will ye just look, since I am here&mdash;just
look and see if the box is all right? there&rsquo;s a good
man!&nbsp; I am old, you know, and my poor remains are not what
my original self was.&nbsp; Look and see if it is where you put
it, there&rsquo;s a good, kind man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the miller good-humouredly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neighbour Loveday! on second thoughts I will take my
box home again, after all, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&nbsp; You
won&rsquo;t deem it ill of me?&nbsp; I have no suspicion, of
course; but now I think on&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s rivalry between
my nephew and your son; and if Festus should take it into his
head to set your house on fire in his enmity, &rsquo;twould be
bad for my deeds and documents.&nbsp; No offence, miller, but
I&rsquo;ll take the box, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith! I don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; said Loveday.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But your nephew had better think twice before he lets his
enmity take that colour.&rsquo;&nbsp; Receding from the window,
he took the candle to a back part of the room and soon reappeared
with the tin box.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t trouble ye to dress,&rsquo; said Derriman
considerately; &lsquo;let en down by anything you have at
hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The box was lowered by a cord, and the old man clasped it in
his arms.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank ye!&rsquo; he said with heartfelt
gratitude.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good-night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The miller replied and closed the window, and the light went
out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, now I hope you are satisfied, sir?&rsquo; said
the trumpet-major.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite, quite!&rsquo; said Derriman; and, leaning on his
walking-stick, he pursued his lonely way.</p>
<p>That night Anne lay awake in her bed, musing on the traits of
the new friend who had come to her neighbour&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
She would not be critical, it was ungenerous and wrong; but she
could not help thinking of what interested her.&nbsp; And were
there, she silently asked, in Miss Johnson&rsquo;s mind and
person such rare qualities as placed that lady altogether beyond
comparison with herself?&nbsp; O yes, there must be; for had not
Captain Bob singled out Matilda from among all other women,
herself included?&nbsp; Of course, with his world-wide
experience, he knew best.</p>
<p>When the moon had set, and only the summer stars threw their
light into the great damp garden, she fancied that she heard
voices in that direction.&nbsp; Perhaps they were the voices of
Bob and Matilda taking a lover&rsquo;s walk before
retiring.&nbsp; If so, how sleepy they would be next day, and how
absurd it was of Matilda to pretend she was tired!&nbsp;
Ruminating in this way, and saying to herself that she hoped they
would be happy, Anne fell asleep.</p>
<h2>XIX.&nbsp; MISS JOHNSON&rsquo;S BEHAVIOUR CAUSES NO LITTLE
SURPRISE</h2>
<p>Partly from the excitement of having his Matilda under the
paternal roof, Bob rose next morning as early as his father and
the grinder, and, when the big wheel began to patter and the
little ones to mumble in response, went to sun himself outside
the mill-front, among the fowls of brown and speckled kinds which
haunted that spot, and the ducks that came up from the
mill-tail.</p>
<p>Standing on the worn-out mill-stone inlaid in the gravel, he
talked with his father on various improvements of the premises,
and on the proposed arrangements for his permanent residence
there, with an enjoyment that was half based upon this prospect
of the future, and half on the penetrating warmth of the sun to
his back and shoulders.&nbsp; Then the different troops of horses
began their morning scramble down to the mill-pond, and, after
making it very muddy round the edge, ascended the slope
again.&nbsp; The bustle of the camp grew more and more audible,
and presently David came to say that breakfast was ready.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Miss Johnson downstairs?&rsquo; said the miller; and
Bob listened for the answer, looking at a blue sentinel aloft on
the down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not yet, maister,&rsquo; said the excellent David.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll wait till she&rsquo;s down,&rsquo; said
Loveday.&nbsp; &lsquo;When she is, let us know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>David went indoors again, and Loveday and Bob continued their
morning survey by ascending into the mysterious quivering
recesses of the mill, and holding a discussion over a second pair
of burr-stones, which had to be re-dressed before they could be
used again.&nbsp; This and similar things occupied nearly twenty
minutes, and, looking from the window, the elder of the two was
reminded of the time of day by seeing Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s
table-cloth fluttering from her back door over the heads of a
flock of pigeons that had alighted for the crumbs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose David can&rsquo;t find us,&rsquo; he said,
with a sense of hunger that was not altogether strange to
Bob.&nbsp; He put out his head and shouted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lady is not down yet,&rsquo; said his man in
reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No hurry, no hurry,&rsquo; said the miller, with
cheerful emptiness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bob, to pass the time
we&rsquo;ll look into the garden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;ll get up sooner than this, you know, when
she&rsquo;s signed articles and got a berth here,&rsquo; Bob
observed apologetically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said Loveday; and they descended into
the garden.</p>
<p>Here they turned over sundry flat stones and killed the slugs
sheltered beneath them from the coming heat of the day, talking
of slugs in all their branches&mdash;of the brown and the black,
of the tough and the tender, of the reason why there were so many
in the garden that year, of the coming time when the grass-walks
harbouring them were to be taken up and gravel laid, and of the
relatively exterminatory merits of a pair of scissors and the
heel of the shoe.&nbsp; At last the miller said, &lsquo;Well,
really, Bob, I&rsquo;m hungry; we must begin without
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were about to go in, when David appeared with haste in
his motions, his eyes wider vertically than crosswise, and his
cheeks nearly all gone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maister, I&rsquo;ve been to call her; and as &lsquo;a
didn&rsquo;t speak I rapped, and as &lsquo;a didn&rsquo;t answer
I kicked, and not being latched the door opened,
and&mdash;she&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob went off like a swallow towards the house, and the miller
followed like the rather heavy man that he was.&nbsp; That Miss
Matilda was not in her room, or a scrap of anything belonging to
her, was soon apparent.&nbsp; They searched every place in which
she could possibly hide or squeeze herself, every place in which
she could not, but found nothing at all.</p>
<p>Captain Bob was quite wild with astonishment and grief.&nbsp;
When he was quite sure that she was nowhere in his father&rsquo;s
house, he ran into Mrs. Garland&rsquo;s, and telling them the
story so hastily that they hardly understood the particulars, he
went on towards Comfort&rsquo;s house, intending to raise the
alarm there, and also at Mitchell&rsquo;s, Beach&rsquo;s,
Cripplestraw&rsquo;s, the parson&rsquo;s, the clerk&rsquo;s, the
camp of dragoons, of hussars, and so on through the whole
county.&nbsp; But he paused, and thought it would be hardly
expedient to publish his discomfiture in such a way.&nbsp; If
Matilda had left the house for any freakish reason he would not
care to look for her, and if her deed had a tragic intent she
would keep aloof from camp and village.</p>
<p>In his trouble he thought of Anne.&nbsp; She was a nice girl
and could be trusted.&nbsp; To her he went, and found her in a
state of excitement and anxiety which equalled his own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis so lonely to cruise for her all by
myself!&rsquo; said Bob disconsolately, his forehead all in
wrinkles, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ve thought you would come with me
and cheer the way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where shall we search?&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, in the holes of rivers, you know, and down wells,
and in quarries, and over cliffs, and like that.&nbsp; Your eyes
might catch the loom of any bit of a shawl or bonnet that I
should overlook, and it would do me a real service.&nbsp; Please
do come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Anne took pity upon him, and put on her hat and went, the
miller and David having gone off in another direction.&nbsp; They
examined the ditches of fields, Bob going round by one fence and
Anne by the other, till they met at the opposite side.&nbsp; Then
they peeped under culverts, into outhouses, and down old wells
and quarries, till the theory of a tragical end had nearly spent
its force in Bob&rsquo;s mind, and he began to think that Matilda
had simply run away.&nbsp; However, they still walked on, though
by this time the sun was hot and Anne would gladly have sat
down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, didn&rsquo;t you think highly of her, Miss
Garland?&rsquo; he inquired, as the search began to languish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said Anne, &lsquo;very highly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was really beautiful; no nonsense about her looks,
was there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None.&nbsp; Her beauty was thoroughly ripe&mdash;not
too young.&nbsp; We should all have got to love her.&nbsp; What
can have possessed her to go away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and, upon my life, I shall soon be
drove to say I don&rsquo;t care!&rsquo; replied the mate
despairingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me pilot ye down over those
stones,&rsquo; he added, as Anne began to descend a rugged
quarry.&nbsp; He stepped forward, leapt down, and turned to
her.</p>
<p>She gave him her hand and sprang down.&nbsp; Before he
relinquished his hold, Captain Bob raised her fingers to his lips
and kissed them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Captain Loveday!&rsquo; cried Anne, snatching away
her hand in genuine dismay, while a tear rose unexpectedly to
each eye.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never heard of such a thing!&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t go an inch further with you, sir; it is too
barefaced!&rsquo;&nbsp; And she turned and ran off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my life I didn&rsquo;t mean it!&rsquo; said the
repentant captain, hastening after.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do love her
best&mdash;indeed I do&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t love you at
all!&nbsp; I am not so fickle as that!&nbsp; I merely just for
the moment admired you as a sweet little craft, and that&rsquo;s
how I came to do it.&nbsp; You know, Miss Garland,&rsquo; he
continued earnestly, and still running after, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis
like this: when you come ashore after having been shut up in a
ship for eighteen months, women-folks seem so new and nice that
you can&rsquo;t help liking them, one and all in a body; and so
your heart is apt to get scattered and to yaw a bit; but of
course I think of poor Matilda most, and shall always stick to
her.&rsquo;&nbsp; He heaved a sigh of tremendous magnitude, to
show beyond the possibility of doubt that his heart was still in
the place that honour required.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear that&mdash;of course I am very
glad!&rsquo; said she, with quick petulance, keeping her face
turned from him.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I hope we shall find her, and
that the wedding will not be put off, and that you&rsquo;ll both
be happy.&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t look for her any more!&nbsp;
No; I don&rsquo;t care to look for her&mdash;and my head
aches.&nbsp; I am going home!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so am I,&rsquo; said Robert promptly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; go on looking for her, of course&mdash;all the
afternoon, and all night.&nbsp; I am sure you will, if you love
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes; I mean to.&nbsp; Still, I ought to convoy you
home first?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you ought not; and I shall not accept your
company.&nbsp; Good-morning, sir!&rsquo;&nbsp; And she went off
over one of the stone stiles with which the spot abounded,
leaving the friendly sailor standing in the field.</p>
<p>He sighed again, and, observing the camp not far off, thought
he would go to his brother John and ask him his opinion on the
sorrowful case.&nbsp; On reaching the tents he found that John
was not at liberty just at that time, being engaged in practising
the trumpeters; and leaving word that he wished the trumpet-major
to come down to the mill as soon as possible, Bob went back
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis no good looking for her,&rsquo; he said
gloomily.&nbsp; &lsquo;She liked me well enough, but when she
came here and saw the house, and the place, and the old horse,
and the plain furniture, she was disappointed to find us all so
homely, and felt she didn&rsquo;t care to marry into such a
family!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His father and David had returned with no news.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, &rsquo;tis as I&rsquo;ve been thinking,
father,&rsquo; Bob said.&nbsp; &lsquo;We weren&rsquo;t good
enough for her, and she went away in scorn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that can&rsquo;t be helped,&rsquo; said the
miller.&nbsp; &lsquo;What we be, we be, and have been for
generations.&nbsp; To my mind she seemed glad enough to get hold
of us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes&mdash;for the moment&mdash;because of the
flowers, and birds, and what&rsquo;s pretty in the place,&rsquo;
said Bob tragically.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t know,
father&mdash;how should you know, who have hardly been out of
Overcombe in your life?&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know what delicate
feelings are in a real refined woman&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Any
little vulgar action unreaves their nerves like a
marline-spike.&nbsp; Now I wonder if you did anything to disgust
her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith! not that I know of,&rsquo; said Loveday,
reflecting.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say a single thing that I
should naturally have said, on purpose to give no
offence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You was always very homely, you know,
father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; so I was,&rsquo; said the miller meekly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder what it could have been,&rsquo; Bob continued,
wandering about restlessly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t go
drinking out of the big mug with your mouth full, or wipe your
lips with your sleeve?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I&rsquo;ll swear I didn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said the
miller firmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thinks I, there&rsquo;s no knowing
what I may do to shock her, so I&rsquo;ll take my solid victuals
in the bakehouse, and only a crumb and a drop in her company for
manners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You could do no more than that, certainly,&rsquo; said
Bob gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If my manners be good enough for well-brought-up people
like the Garlands, they be good enough for her,&rsquo; continued
the miller, with a sense of injustice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; Then it must have been
David.&nbsp; David, come here!&nbsp; How did you behave before
that lady?&nbsp; Now, mind you speak the truth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Mr. Captain Robert,&rsquo; said David
earnestly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I assure ye she was served like a royal
queen.&nbsp; The best silver spoons wez put down, and yer poor
grandfer&rsquo;s silver tanket, as you seed, and the feather
cushion for her to sit on&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got it!&rsquo; said Bob decisively,
bringing down his hand upon the window-sill.&nbsp; &lsquo;Her bed
was hard!&mdash;and there&rsquo;s nothing shocks a true lady like
that.&nbsp; The bed in that room always was as hard as the Rock
of Gibraltar!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Captain Bob!&nbsp; The beds were
changed&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t they maister?&nbsp; We put the goose
bed in her room, and the flock one, that used to be there, in
yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, we did,&rsquo; corroborated the miller.&nbsp;
&lsquo;David and I changed &rsquo;em with our own hands, because
they were too heavy for the women to move.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure I didn&rsquo;t know I had the flock bed,&rsquo;
murmured Bob.&nbsp; &lsquo;I slept on, little thinking what I was
going to wake to.&nbsp; Well, well, she&rsquo;s gone; and search
as I will I shall never find another like her!&nbsp; She was too
good for me.&nbsp; She must have carried her box with her own
hands, poor girl.&nbsp; As far as that goes, I could overtake her
even now, I dare say; but I won&rsquo;t entreat her against her
will&mdash;not I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miller Loveday and David, feeling themselves to be rather a
desecration in the presence of Bob&rsquo;s sacred emotions,
managed to edge off by degrees, the former burying himself in the
most floury recesses of the mill, his invariable resource when
perturbed, the rumbling having a soothing effect upon the nerves
of those properly trained to its music.</p>
<p>Bob was so impatient that, after going up to her room to
assure himself once more that she had not undressed, but had only
lain down on the outside of the bed, he went out of the house to
meet John, and waited on the sunny slope of the down till his
brother appeared.&nbsp; John looked so brave and shapely and
warlike that, even in Bob&rsquo;s present distress, he could not
but feel an honest and affectionate pride at owning such a
relative.&nbsp; Yet he fancied that John did not come along with
the same swinging step he had shown yesterday; and when the
trumpet-major got nearer he looked anxiously at the mate and
waited for him to speak first.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know our great trouble, John?&rsquo; said Robert,
gazing stoically into his brother&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come and sit down, and tell me all about it,&rsquo;
answered the trumpet-major, showing no surprise.</p>
<p>They went towards a slight ravine, where it was easier to sit
down than on the flat ground, and here John reclined among the
grasshoppers, pointing to his brother to do the same.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But do you know what it is?&rsquo; said Robert.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Has anybody told ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do know,&rsquo; said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
gone; and I am thankful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; said Bob, rising to his knees in
amazement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m at the bottom of it,&rsquo; said the
trumpet-major slowly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You, John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and if you will listen I&rsquo;ll tell you
all.&nbsp; Do you remember what happened when I came into the
room last night?&nbsp; Why, she turned colour and nearly fainted
away.&nbsp; That was because she knew me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob stared at his brother with a face of pain and
distrust.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For once, Bob, I must say something that will hurt thee
a good deal,&rsquo; continued John.&nbsp; &lsquo;She was not a
woman who could possibly be your wife&mdash;and so she&rsquo;s
gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You sent her off?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;John!&mdash;Tell me right through&mdash;tell
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I had better,&rsquo; said the trumpet-major,
his blue eyes resting on the far distant sea, that seemed to rise
like a wall as high as the hill they sat upon.</p>
<p>And then he told a tale of Miss Johnson and the --th Dragoons
which wrung his heart as much in the telling as it did
Bob&rsquo;s to hear, and which showed that John had been
temporarily cruel to be ultimately kind.&nbsp; Even Bob, excited
as he was, could discern from John&rsquo;s manner of speaking
what a terrible undertaking that night&rsquo;s business had been
for him.&nbsp; To justify the course he had adopted the dictates
of duty must have been imperative; but the trumpet-major, with a
becoming reticence which his brother at the time was naturally
unable to appreciate, scarcely dwelt distinctly enough upon the
compelling cause of his conduct.&nbsp; It would, indeed, have
been hard for any man, much less so modest a one as John, to do
himself justice in that remarkable relation, when the listener
was the lady&rsquo;s lover; and it is no wonder that Robert rose
to his feet and put a greater distance between himself and
John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what time was it?&rsquo; he asked in a hard,
suppressed voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was just before one o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could you help her to go away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had a pass.&nbsp; I carried her box to the
coach-office.&nbsp; She was to follow at dawn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she had no money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she had; I took particular care of
that.&rsquo;&nbsp; John did not add, as he might have done, that
he had given her, in his pity, all the money he possessed, and at
present had only eighteen-pence in the world.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
it is over, Bob; so sit ye down, and talk with me of old
times,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Jack, it is well enough for you to speak like
that,&rsquo; said the disquieted sailor; &lsquo;but I can&rsquo;t
help feeling that it is a cruel thing you have done.&nbsp; After
all, she would have been snug enough for me.&nbsp; Would I had
never found out this about her!&nbsp; John, why did you
interfere?&nbsp; You had no right to overhaul my affairs like
this.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me fairly all you knew, and
let me do as I chose?&nbsp; You have turned her out of the house,
and it&rsquo;s a shame!&nbsp; If she had only come to me!&nbsp;
Why didn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because she knew it was best to do
otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I shall go after her,&rsquo; said Bob firmly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can do as you like,&rsquo; said John; &lsquo;but I
would advise you strongly to leave matters where they
are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t leave matters where they are,&rsquo; said
Bob impetuously.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have made me miserable, and all
for nothing.&nbsp; I tell you she was good enough for me; and as
long as I knew nothing about what you say of her history, what
difference would it have made to me?&nbsp; Never was there a
young woman who was better company; and she loved a merry song as
I do myself.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;ll follow her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Bob,&rsquo; said John; &lsquo;I hardly expected
this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s because you didn&rsquo;t know your
man.&nbsp; Can I ask you to do me one kindness?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t suppose I can.&nbsp; Can I ask you not to say a word
against her to any of them at home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; The very reason why I got her to go
off silently, as she has done, was because nothing should be said
against her here, and no scandal should be heard of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That may be; but I&rsquo;m off after her.&nbsp; Marry
that girl I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That we shall see,&rsquo; replied Robert with
determination; and he went away rapidly towards the mill.&nbsp;
The trumpet-major had no heart to follow&mdash;no good could
possibly come of further opposition; and there on the down he
remained like a graven image till Bob had vanished from his sight
into the mill.</p>
<p>Bob entered his father&rsquo;s only to leave word that he was
going on a renewed search for Matilda, and to pack up a few
necessaries for his journey.&nbsp; Ten minutes later he came out
again with a bundle in his hand, and John saw him go diagonally
across the lower fields towards the high-road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And this is all the good I have done!&rsquo; said John,
musingly readjusting his stock where it cut his neck, and
descending towards the mill.</p>
<h2>XX.&nbsp; HOW THEY LESSENED THE EFFECT OF THE CALAMITY</h2>
<p>Meanwhile Anne Garland had gone home, and, being weary with
her ramble in search of Matilda, sat silent in a corner of the
room.&nbsp; Her mother was passing the time in giving utterance
to every conceivable surmise on the cause of Miss Johnson&rsquo;s
disappearance that the human mind could frame, to which Anne
returned monosyllabic answers, the result, not of indifference,
but of intense preoccupation.&nbsp; Presently Loveday, the
father, came to the door; her mother vanished with him, and they
remained closeted together a long time.&nbsp; Anne went into the
garden and seated herself beneath the branching tree whose boughs
had sheltered her during so many hours of her residence
here.&nbsp; Her attention was fixed more upon the miller&rsquo;s
wing of the irregular building before her than upon that occupied
by her mother, for she could not help expecting every moment to
see some one run out with a wild face and announce some awful
clearing up of the mystery.</p>
<p>Every sound set her on the alert, and hearing the tread of a
horse in the lane she looked round eagerly.&nbsp; Gazing at her
over the hedge was Festus Derriman, mounted on such an incredibly
tall animal that he could see to her very feet over the thick and
broad thorn fence.&nbsp; She no sooner recognized him than she
withdrew her glance; but as his eyes were fixed steadily upon her
this was a futile manoeuvre.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw you look round!&rsquo; he exclaimed
crossly.&nbsp; &lsquo;What have I done to make you behave like
that?&nbsp; Come, Miss Garland, be fair.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis no use
to turn your back upon me.&rsquo;&nbsp; As she did not turn he
went on&mdash;&lsquo;Well, now, this is enough to provoke a
saint.&nbsp; Now I tell you what, Miss Garland; here I&rsquo;ll
stay till you do turn round, if &rsquo;tis all the
afternoon.&nbsp; You know my temper&mdash;what I say I
mean.&rsquo;&nbsp; He seated himself firmly in the saddle,
plucked some leaves from the hedge, and began humming a song, to
show how absolutely indifferent he was to the flight of time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you come for, that you are so anxious to see
me?&rsquo; inquired Anne, when at last he had wearied her
patience, rising and facing him with the added independence which
came from a sense of the hedge between them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, I knew you would turn round!&rsquo; he said, his
hot angry face invaded by a smile in which his teeth showed like
white hemmed in by red at chess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want, Mr. Derriman?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What do you want, Mr. Derriman?&rdquo;&mdash;now
listen to that!&nbsp; Is that my encouragement?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne bowed superciliously, and moved away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have just heard news that explains all that,&rsquo;
said the giant, eyeing her movements with somnolent
irascibility.&nbsp; &lsquo;My uncle has been letting things
out.&nbsp; He was here late last night, and he saw
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed he didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, now!&nbsp; He saw Trumpet-major Loveday courting
somebody like you in that garden walk; and when he came you ran
indoors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not true, and I wish to hear no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my life, he said so!&nbsp; How can you do it, Miss
Garland, when I, who have enough money to buy up all the
Lovedays, would gladly come to terms with ye?&nbsp; What a
simpleton you must be, to pass me over for him!&nbsp; There, now
you are angry because I said simpleton!&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean
simpleton, I meant misguided&mdash;misguided rosebud!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s it&mdash;run off,&rsquo; he continued in a raised
voice, as Anne made towards the garden door.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
I&rsquo;ll have you yet.&nbsp; Much reason you have to be too
proud to stay with me.&nbsp; But it won&rsquo;t last long; I
shall marry you, madam, if I choose, as you&rsquo;ll
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he was quite gone, and Anne had calmed down from the not
altogether unrelished fear and excitement that he always caused
her, she returned to her seat under the tree, and began to wonder
what Festus Derriman&rsquo;s story meant, which, from the
earnestness of his tone, did not seem like a pure
invention.&nbsp; It suddenly flashed upon her mind that she
herself had heard voices in the garden, and that the persons seen
by Farmer Derriman, of whose visit and reclamation of his box the
miller had told her, might have been Matilda and John
Loveday.&nbsp; She further recalled the strange agitation of Miss
Johnson on the preceding evening, and that it occurred just at
the entry of the dragoon, till by degrees suspicion amounted to
conviction that he knew more than any one else supposed of that
lady&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>It was just at this time that the trumpet-major descended to
the mill after his talk with his brother on the down.&nbsp; As
fate would have it, instead of entering the house he turned aside
to the garden and walked down that pleasant enclosure, to learn
if he were likely to find in the other half of it the woman he
loved so well.</p>
<p>Yes, there she was, sitting on the seat of logs that he had
repaired for her, under the apple-tree; but she was not facing in
his direction.&nbsp; He walked with a noisier tread, he coughed,
he shook a bough, he did everything, in short, but the one thing
that Festus did in the same circumstances&mdash;call out to
her.&nbsp; He would not have ventured on that for the
world.&nbsp; Any of his signs would have been sufficient to
attract her a day or two earlier; now she would not turn.&nbsp;
At last, in his fond anxiety, he did what he had never done
before without an invitation, and crossed over into Mrs.
Garland&rsquo;s half of the garden, till he stood before her.</p>
<p>When she could not escape him she arose, and, saying
&lsquo;Good afternoon, trumpet-major,&rsquo; in a glacial manner
unusual with her, walked away to another part of the garden.</p>
<p>Loveday, quite at a loss, had not the strength of mind to
persevere further.&nbsp; He had a vague apprehension that some
imperfect knowledge of the previous night&rsquo;s unhappy
business had reached her; and, unable to remedy the evil without
telling more than he dared, he went into the mill, where his
father still was, looking doleful enough, what with his concern
at events and the extra quantity of flour upon his face through
sticking so closely to business that day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, John; Bob has told you all, of course?&nbsp; A
queer, strange, perplexing thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t make it out at all.&nbsp; There must be something
wrong in the woman, or it couldn&rsquo;t have happened.&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t been so upset for years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor have I.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t it should have
happened for all I own in the world,&rsquo; said the
dragoon.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you spoke to Anne Garland
to-day&mdash;or has anybody been talking to her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Festus Derriman rode by half-an-hour ago, and talked to
her over the hedge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John guessed the rest, and, after standing on the threshold in
silence awhile, walked away towards the camp.</p>
<p>All this time his brother Robert had been hastening along in
pursuit of the woman who had withdrawn from the scene to avoid
the exposure and complete overthrow which would have resulted had
she remained.&nbsp; As the distance lengthened between himself
and the mill, Bob was conscious of some cooling down of the
excitement that had prompted him to set out; but he did not pause
in his walk till he had reached the head of the river which fed
the mill-stream.&nbsp; Here, for some indefinite reason, he
allowed his eyes to be attracted by the bubbling spring whose
waters never failed or lessened, and he stopped as if to look
longer at the scene; it was really because his mind was so
absorbed by John&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>The sun was warm, the spot was a pleasant one, and he
deposited his bundle and sat down.&nbsp; By degrees, as he
reflected, first on John&rsquo;s view and then on his own, his
convictions became unsettled; till at length he was so balanced
between the impulse to go on and the impulse to go back, that a
puff of wind either way would have been well-nigh sufficient to
decide for him.&nbsp; When he allowed John&rsquo;s story to
repeat itself in his ears, the reasonableness and good sense of
his advice seemed beyond question.&nbsp; When, on the other hand,
he thought of his poor Matilda&rsquo;s eyes, and her, to him,
pleasant ways, their charming arrangements to marry, and her
probable willingness still, he could hardly bring himself to do
otherwise than follow on the road at the top of his speed.</p>
<p>This strife of thought was so well maintained that sitting and
standing, he remained on the borders of the spring till the
shadows had stretched out eastwards, and the chance of overtaking
Matilda had grown considerably less.&nbsp; Still he did not
positively go towards home.&nbsp; At last he took a guinea from
his pocket, and resolved to put the question to the hazard.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Heads I go; tails I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&nbsp; The piece of
gold spun in the air and came down heads.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t go, after all,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be steered by accidents any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He picked up his bundle and switch, and retraced his steps
towards Overcombe Mill, knocking down the brambles and nettles as
he went with gloomy and indifferent blows.&nbsp; When he got
within sight of the house he beheld David in the road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right&mdash;all right again, captain!&rsquo;,
shouted that retainer.&nbsp; &lsquo;A wedding after all!&nbsp;
Hurrah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;she&rsquo;s back again?&rsquo; cried Bob,
seizing David, ecstatically, and dancing round with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;but it&rsquo;s all the same! it is of no
consequence at all, and no harm will be done!&nbsp; Maister and
Mrs. Garland have made up a match, and mean to marry at once,
that the wedding victuals may not be wasted!&nbsp; They felt
&rsquo;twould be a thousand pities to let such good things get
blue-vinnied for want of a ceremony to use &rsquo;em upon, and at
last they have thought of this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Victuals&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care for the
victuals!&rsquo; bitterly cried Bob, in a tone of far higher
thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;How you disappoint me!&rsquo; and he went
slowly towards the house.</p>
<p>His father appeared in the opening of the mill-door, looking
more cheerful than when they had parted.&nbsp; &lsquo;What,
Robert, you&rsquo;ve been after her?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Faith, then, I wouldn&rsquo;t have followed her if I had
been as sure as you were that she went away in scorn of us.&nbsp;
Since you told me that, I have not looked for her at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was wrong, father,&rsquo; Bob replied gravely,
throwing down his bundle and stick.&nbsp; &lsquo;Matilda, I find,
has not gone away in scorn of us; she has gone away for other
reasons.&nbsp; I followed her some way; but I have come back
again.&nbsp; She may go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why is she gone?&rsquo; said the astonished miller.</p>
<p>Bob had intended, for Matilda&rsquo;s sake, to give no reason
to a living soul for her departure.&nbsp; But he could not treat
his father thus reservedly; and he told.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has made great fools of us,&rsquo; said the miller
deliberately; &lsquo;and she might have made us greater
ones.&nbsp; Bob, I thought th&rsquo; hadst more sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t say anything against her,
father,&rsquo; implored Bob.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas a sorry
haul, and there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Let her down
quietly, and keep the secret.&nbsp; You promise that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do.&rsquo;&nbsp; Loveday the elder remained thinking
awhile, and then went on&mdash;&lsquo;Well, what I was going to
say is this: I&rsquo;ve hit upon a plan to get out of the awkward
corner she has put us in.&nbsp; What you&rsquo;ll think of it I
can&rsquo;t say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;David has just given me the heads.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do it hurt your feelings, my son, at such a
time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;ll bring myself to bear it,
anyhow!&nbsp; Why should I object to other people&rsquo;s
happiness because I have lost my own?&rsquo; said Bob, with
saintly self-sacrifice in his air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well said!&rsquo; answered the miller heartily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But you may be sure that there will be no unseemly
rejoicing, to disturb ye in your present frame of mind.&nbsp; All
the morning I felt more ashamed than I cared to own at the
thought of how the neighbours, great and small, would laugh at
what they would call your folly, when they knew what had
happened; so I resolved to take this step to stave it off, if so
be &rsquo;twas possible.&nbsp; And when I saw Mrs. Garland I knew
I had done right.&nbsp; She pitied me so much for having had the
house cleaned in vain, and laid in provisions to waste, that it
put her into the humour to agree.&nbsp; We mean to do it right
off at once, afore the pies and cakes get mouldy and the blackpot
stale.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a good thought of mine and hers, and I
am glad &rsquo;tis settled,&rsquo; he concluded cheerfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Matilda!&rsquo; murmured Bob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&mdash;I was afraid &rsquo;twould hurt thy
feelings,&rsquo; said the miller, with self-reproach:
&lsquo;making preparations for thy wedding, and using them for my
own!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Bob heroically; &lsquo;it shall
not.&nbsp; It will be a great comfort in my sorrow to feel that
the splendid grub, and the ale, and your stunning new suit of
clothes, and the great table-cloths you&rsquo;ve bought, will be
just as useful now as if I had married myself.&nbsp; Poor
Matilda!&nbsp; But you won&rsquo;t expect me to join in&mdash;you
hardly can.&nbsp; I can sheer off that day very easily, you
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Bob!&rsquo; said the miller
reproachfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand it&mdash;I should break
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Deuce take me if I would have asked her, then, if I had
known &rsquo;twas going to drive thee out of the house!&nbsp;
Now, come, Bob, I&rsquo;ll find a way of arranging it and
sobering it down, so that it shall be as melancholy as you can
require&mdash;in short, just like a funeral, if thou&rsquo;lt
promise to stay?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the afflicted one.&nbsp;
&lsquo;On that condition I&rsquo;ll stay.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>XXI.&nbsp; &lsquo;UPON THE HILL HE TURNED&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Having entered into this solemn compact with his son, the
elder Loveday&rsquo;s next action was to go to Mrs. Garland, and
ask her how the toning down of the wedding had best be
done.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is plain enough that to make merry just now
would be slighting Bob&rsquo;s feelings, as if we didn&rsquo;t
care who was not married, so long as we were,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But then, what&rsquo;s to be done about the
victuals?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give a dinner to the poor folk,&rsquo; she
suggested.&nbsp; &lsquo;We can get everything used up that
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true&rsquo; said the miller.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s enough of &rsquo;em in these times to carry
off any extras whatsoever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it will save Bob&rsquo;s feelings
wonderfully.&nbsp; And they won&rsquo;t know that the dinner was
got for another sort of wedding and another sort of guests; so
you&rsquo;ll have their good-will for nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The miller smiled at the subtlety of the view.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That can hardly be called fair,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Still, I did mean some of it for them, for the friends we
meant to ask would not have cleared all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Upon the whole the idea pleased him well, particularly when he
noticed the forlorn look of his sailor son as he walked about the
place, and pictured the inevitably jarring effect of fiddles and
tambourines upon Bob&rsquo;s shattered nerves at such a crisis,
even if the notes of the former were dulled by the application of
a mute, and Bob shut up in a distant bedroom&mdash;a plan which
had at first occurred to him.&nbsp; He therefore told Bob that
the surcharged larder was to be emptied by the charitable process
above alluded to, and hoped he would not mind making himself
useful in such a good and gloomy work.&nbsp; Bob readily fell in
with the scheme, and it was at once put in hand and the tables
spread.</p>
<p>The alacrity with which the substituted wedding was carried
out, seemed to show that the worthy pair of neighbours would have
joined themselves into one long ago, had there previously
occurred any domestic incident dictating such a step as an
apposite expedient, apart from their personal wish to marry.</p>
<p>The appointed morning came, and the service quietly took place
at the cheerful hour of ten, in the face of a triangular
congregation, of which the base was the front pew, and the apex
the west door.&nbsp; Mrs. Garland dressed herself in the muslin
shawl like Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s, that Bob had brought home,
and her best plum-coloured gown, beneath which peeped out her
shoes with red rosettes.&nbsp; Anne was present, but she
considerately toned herself down, so as not to too seriously
damage her mother&rsquo;s appearance.&nbsp; At moments during the
ceremony she had a distressing sense that she ought not to be
born, and was glad to get home again.</p>
<p>The interest excited in the village, though real, was hardly
enough to bring a serious blush to the face of coyness.&nbsp;
Neighbours&rsquo; minds had become so saturated by the abundance
of showy military and regal incident lately vouchsafed to them,
that the wedding of middle-aged civilians was of small account,
excepting in so far that it solved the question whether or not
Mrs. Garland would consider herself too genteel to mate with a
grinder of corn.</p>
<p>In the evening, Loveday&rsquo;s heart was made glad by seeing
the baked and boiled in rapid process of consumption by the
kitchenful of people assembled for that purpose.&nbsp;
Three-quarters of an hour were sufficient to banish for ever his
fears as to spoilt food.&nbsp; The provisions being the cause of
the assembly, and not its consequence, it had been determined to
get all that would not keep consumed on that day, even if
highways and hedges had to be searched for operators.&nbsp; And,
in addition to the poor and needy, every cottager&rsquo;s
daughter known to the miller was invited, and told to bring her
lover from camp&mdash;an expedient which, for letting daylight
into the inside of full platters, was among the most happy ever
known.</p>
<p>While Mr. and Mrs. Loveday, Anne, and Bob were standing in the
parlour, discussing the progress of the entertainment in the next
room, John, who had not been down all day, entered the house and
looked in upon them through the open door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How&rsquo;s this, John?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you come
before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had to see the captain, and&mdash;other duties,&rsquo;
said the trumpet-major, in a tone which showed no great zeal for
explanations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, come in, however,&rsquo; continued the miller, as
his son remained with his hand on the door-post, surveying them
reflectively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot stay long,&rsquo; said John, advancing.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Route is come, and we are going away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going away!&nbsp; Where to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Exonbury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Friday morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; some to-morrow and some next day.&nbsp; The King
goes next week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry for this,&rsquo; said the miller, not
expressing half his sorrow by the simple utterance.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I wish you could have been here to-day, since this is the
case,&rsquo; he added, looking at the horizon through the
window.</p>
<p>Mrs. Loveday also expressed her regret, which seemed to remind
the trumpet-major of the event of the day, and he went to her and
tried to say something befitting the occasion.&nbsp; Anne had not
said that she was either sorry or glad, but John Loveday fancied
that she had looked rather relieved than otherwise when she heard
his news.&nbsp; His conversation with Bob on the down made
Bob&rsquo;s manner, too, remarkably cool, notwithstanding that he
had after all followed his brother&rsquo;s advice, which it was
as yet too soon after the event for him to rightly value.&nbsp;
John did not know why the sailor had come back, never supposing
that it was because he had thought better of going, and said to
him privately, &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t overtake her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t try to,&rsquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you are not going to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I shall let her drift.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad indeed, Bob; you have been wise,&rsquo; said
John heartily.</p>
<p>Bob, however, still loved Matilda too well to be other than
dissatisfied with John and the event that he had precipitated,
which the elder brother only too promptly perceived; and it made
his stay that evening of short duration.&nbsp; Before leaving he
said with some hesitation to his father, including Anne and her
mother by his glance, &lsquo;Do you think to come up and see us
off?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The miller answered for them all, and said that of course they
would come.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you&rsquo;ll step down again between
now and then?&rsquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try to.&rsquo;&nbsp; He added after a pause,
&lsquo;In case I should not, remember that Revalley will sound at
half past five; we shall leave about eight.&nbsp; Next summer,
perhaps, we shall come and camp here again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; said his father and Mrs. Loveday.</p>
<p>There was something in John&rsquo;s manner which indicated to
Anne that he scarcely intended to come down again; but the others
did not notice it, and she said nothing.&nbsp; He departed a few
minutes later, in the dusk of the August evening, leaving Anne
still in doubt as to the meaning of his private meeting with Miss
Johnson.</p>
<p>John Loveday had been going to tell them that on the last
night, by an especial privilege, it would be in his power to come
and stay with them until eleven o&rsquo;clock, but at the moment
of leaving he abandoned the intention.&nbsp; Anne&rsquo;s
attitude had chilled him, and made him anxious to be off.&nbsp;
He utilized the spare hours of that last night in another
way.</p>
<p>This was by coming down from the outskirts of the camp in the
evening, and seating himself near the brink of the mill-pond as
soon as it was quite dark; where he watched the lights in the
different windows till one appeared in Anne&rsquo;s bedroom, and
she herself came forward to shut the casement, with the candle in
her hand.&nbsp; The light shone out upon the broad and deep
mill-head, illuminating to a distinct individuality every moth
and gnat that entered the quivering chain of radiance stretching
across the water towards him, and every bubble or atom of froth
that floated into its width.&nbsp; She stood for some time
looking out, little thinking what the darkness concealed on the
other side of that wide stream; till at length she closed the
casement, drew the curtains, and retreated into the room.&nbsp;
Presently the light went out, upon which John Loveday returned to
camp and lay down in his tent.</p>
<p>The next morning was dull and windy, and the trumpets of the
--th sounded Reveille for the last time on Overcombe Down.&nbsp;
Knowing that the Dragoons were going away, Anne had slept
heedfully, and was at once awakened by the smart notes.&nbsp; She
looked out of the window, to find that the miller was already
astir, his white form being visible at the end of his garden,
where he stood motionless, watching the preparations.&nbsp; Anne
also looked on as well as she could through the dim grey gloom,
and soon she saw the blue smoke from the cooks&rsquo; fires
creeping fitfully along the ground, instead of rising in vertical
columns, as it had done during the fine weather season.&nbsp;
Then the men began to carry their bedding to the waggons, and
others to throw all refuse into the trenches, till the down was
lively as an ant-hill.&nbsp; Anne did not want to see John
Loveday again, but hearing the household astir, she began to
dress at leisure, looking out at the camp the while.</p>
<p>When the soldiers had breakfasted, she saw them selling and
giving away their superfluous crockery to the natives who had
clustered round; and then they pulled down and cleared away the
temporary kitchens which they had constructed when they
came.&nbsp; A tapping of tent-pegs and wriggling of picket-posts
followed, and soon the cones of white canvas, now almost become a
component part of the landscape, fell to the ground.&nbsp; At
this moment the miller came indoors and asked at the foot of the
stairs if anybody was going up the hill with him.</p>
<p>Anne felt that, in spite of the cloud hanging over John in her
mind, it would ill become the present moment not to see him off,
and she went downstairs to her mother, who was already there,
though Bob was nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; Each took an arm of the
miller, and thus climbed to the top of the hill.&nbsp; By this
time the men and horses were at the place of assembly, and,
shortly after the mill-party reached level ground, the troops
slowly began to move forward.&nbsp; When the trumpet-major, half
buried in his uniform, arms, and horse-furniture, drew near to
the spot where the Lovedays were waiting to see him pass, his
father turned anxiously to Anne and said, &lsquo;You will shake
hands with John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne faintly replied &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and allowed the miller
to take her forward on his arm to the trackway, so as to be close
to the flank of the approaching column.&nbsp; It came up, many
people on each side grasping the hands of the troopers in bidding
them farewell; and as soon as John Loveday saw the members of his
father&rsquo;s household, he stretched down his hand across his
right pistol for the same performance.&nbsp; The miller gave his,
then Mrs. Loveday gave hers, and then the hand of the
trumpet-major was extended towards Anne.&nbsp; But as the horse
did not absolutely stop, it was a somewhat awkward performance
for a young woman to undertake, and, more on that account than on
any other, Anne drew back, and the gallant trooper passed by
without receiving her adieu.&nbsp; Anne&rsquo;s heart reproached
her for a moment; and then she thought that, after all, he was
not going off to immediate battle, and that she would in all
probability see him again at no distant date, when she hoped that
the mystery of his conduct would be explained.&nbsp; Her thoughts
were interrupted by a voice at her elbow: &lsquo;Thank heaven,
he&rsquo;s gone!&nbsp; Now there&rsquo;s a chance for
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned, and Festus Derriman was standing by her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no chance for you,&rsquo; she said
indignantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because there&rsquo;s another left!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The words had slipped out quite unintentionally, and she
blushed quickly.&nbsp; She would have given anything to be able
to recall them; but he had heard, and said,
&lsquo;Who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne went forward to the miller to avoid replying, and Festus
caught her no more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has anybody been hanging about Overcombe Mill except
Loveday&rsquo;s son the soldier?&rsquo; he asked of a
comrade.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His son the sailor,&rsquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;his son the sailor,&rsquo; said Festus
slowly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Damn his son the sailor!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>XXII.&nbsp; THE TWO HOUSEHOLDS UNITED</h2>
<p>At this particular moment the object of Festus
Derriman&rsquo;s fulmination was assuredly not dangerous as a
rival.&nbsp; Bob, after abstractedly watching the soldiers from
the front of the house till they were out of sight, had gone
within doors and seated himself in the mill-parlour, where his
father found him, his elbows resting on the table and his
forehead on his hands, his eyes being fixed upon a document that
lay open before him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What art perusing, Bob, with such a long
face?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob sighed, and then Mrs. Loveday and Anne entered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis only a state-paper that I fondly thought I
should have a use for,&rsquo; he said gloomily.&nbsp; And,
looking down as before, he cleared his voice, as if moved
inwardly to go on, and began to read in feeling tones from what
proved to be his nullified marriage licence:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Timothy Titus Philemon, by permission Bishop of
Bristol: To our well-beloved Robert Loveday, of the parish of
Overcombe, Bachelor; and Matilda Johnson, of the same parish,
Spinster.&nbsp; Greeting.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Anne sighed, but contrived to keep down her sigh to a
mere nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beautiful language, isn&rsquo;t it!&rsquo; said
Bob.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was never greeted like that afore!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I have often thought it very excellent language
myself,&rsquo; said Mrs. Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come to that, the old gentleman will greet thee like it
again any day for a couple of guineas,&rsquo; said the
miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not the point, father!&nbsp; You never
could see the real meaning of these things. . . .&nbsp; Well,
then he goes on: &ldquo;Whereas ye are, as it is alleged,
determined to enter into the holy estate of
matrimony&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But why should I read on?&nbsp; It
all means nothing now&mdash;nothing, and the splendid words are
all wasted upon air.&nbsp; It seems as if I had been hailed by
some venerable hoary prophet, and had turned away, put the helm
hard up, and wouldn&rsquo;t hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nobody replied, feeling probably that sympathy could not meet
the case, and Bob went on reading the rest of it to himself,
occasionally heaving a breath like the wind in a ship&rsquo;s
shrouds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t set my mind so much upon her, if I was
thee,&rsquo; said his father at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, folk might call thee a fool, and say thy brains
were turning to water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob was apparently much struck by this thought, and, instead
of continuing the discourse further, he carefully folded up the
licence, went out, and walked up and down the garden.&nbsp; It
was startlingly apt what his father had said; and, worse than
that, what people would call him might be true, and the
liquefaction of his brains turn out to be no fable.&nbsp; By
degrees he became much concerned, and the more he examined
himself by this new light the more clearly did he perceive that
he was in a very bad way.</p>
<p>On reflection he remembered that since Miss Johnson&rsquo;s
departure his appetite had decreased amazingly.&nbsp; He had
eaten in meat no more than fourteen or fifteen ounces a day, but
one-third of a quartern pudding on an average, in vegetables only
a small heap of potatoes and half a York cabbage, and no gravy
whatever; which, considering the usual appetite of a seaman for
fresh food at the end of a long voyage, was no small index of the
depression of his mind.&nbsp; Then he had waked once every night,
and on one occasion twice.&nbsp; While dressing each morning
since the gloomy day he had not whistled more than seven bars of
a hornpipe without stopping and falling into thought of a most
painful kind; and he had told none but absolutely true stories of
foreign parts to the neighbouring villagers when they saluted and
clustered about him, as usual, for anything he chose to pour
forth&mdash;except that story of the whale whose eye was about as
large as the round pond in Derriman&rsquo;s ewe-lease&mdash;which
was like tempting fate to set a seal for ever upon his tongue as
a traveller.&nbsp; All this enervation, mental and physical, had
been produced by Matilda&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>He also considered what he had lost of the rational amusements
of manhood during these unfortunate days.&nbsp; He might have
gone to the neighbouring fashionable resort every afternoon,
stood before Gloucester Lodge till the King and Queen came out,
held his hat in his hand, and enjoyed their Majesties&rsquo;
smiles at his homage all for nothing&mdash;watched the
picket-mounting, heard the different bands strike up, observed
the staff; and, above all, have seen the pretty town girls go
trip-trip-trip along the esplanade, deliberately fixing their
innocent eyes on the distant sea, the grey cliffs, and the sky,
and accidentally on the soldiers and himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll raze out her image,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She shall make a fool of me no more.&rsquo;&nbsp; And his
resolve resulted in conduct which had elements of real
greatness.</p>
<p>He went back to his father, whom he found in the
mill-loft.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis true, father, what you
say,&rsquo; he observed: &lsquo;my brains will turn to
bilge-water if I think of her much longer.&nbsp; By the oath of
a&mdash;navigator, I wish I could sigh less and laugh more!
She&rsquo;s gone&mdash;why can&rsquo;t I let her go, and be
happy?&nbsp; But how begin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take it careless, my son,&rsquo; said the miller,
&lsquo;and lay yourself out to enjoy snacks and
cordials.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;that&rsquo;s a thought!&rsquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baccy is good for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; So is sperrits.&nbsp;
Though I don&rsquo;t advise thee to drink neat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baccy&mdash;I&rsquo;d almost forgot it!&rsquo; said
Captain Loveday.</p>
<p>He went to his room, hastily untied the package of tobacco
that he had brought home, and began to make use of it in his own
way, calling to David for a bottle of the old household mead that
had lain in the cellar these eleven years.&nbsp; He was
discovered by his father three-quarters of an hour later as a
half-invisible object behind a cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>The miller drew a breath of relief.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
Bob,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I thought the house was
a-fire!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m smoking rather fast to drown my reflections,
father.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis no use to chaw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To tempt his attenuated appetite the unhappy mate made David
cook an omelet and bake a seed-cake, the latter so richly
compounded that it opened to the knife like a freckled
buttercup.&nbsp; With the same object he stuck night-lines into
the banks of the mill-pond, and drew up next morning a family of
fat eels, some of which were skinned and prepared for his
breakfast.&nbsp; They were his favourite fish, but such had been
his condition that, until the moment of making this effort, he
had quite forgotten their existence at his father&rsquo;s
back-door.</p>
<p>In a few days Bob Loveday had considerably improved in tone
and vigour.&nbsp; One other obvious remedy for his dejection was
to indulge in the society of Miss Garland, love being so much
more effectually got rid of by displacement than by attempted
annihilation.&nbsp; But Loveday&rsquo;s belief that he had
offended her beyond forgiveness, and his ever-present sense of
her as a woman who by education and antecedents was fitted to
adorn a higher sphere than his own, effectually kept him from
going near her for a long time, notwithstanding that they were
inmates of one house.&nbsp; The reserve was, however, in some
degree broken by the appearance one morning, later in the season,
of the point of a saw through the partition which divided
Anne&rsquo;s room from the Loveday half of the house.&nbsp;
Though she dined and supped with her mother and the Loveday
family, Miss Garland had still continued to occupy her old
apartments, because she found it more convenient there to pursue
her hobbies of wool-work and of copying her father&rsquo;s old
pictures.&nbsp; The division wall had not as yet been broken
down.</p>
<p>As the saw worked its way downwards under her astonished gaze
Anne jumped up from her drawing; and presently the temporary
canvasing and papering which had sealed up the old door of
communication was cut completely through.&nbsp; The door burst
open, and Bob stood revealed on the other side, with the saw in
his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your ladyship&rsquo;s pardon,&rsquo; he said,
taking off the hat he had been working in, as his handsome face
expanded into a smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know this door
opened into your private room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Captain Loveday!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am pulling down the division on principle, as we are
now one family.&nbsp; But I really thought the door opened into
your passage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It don&rsquo;t matter; I can get another
room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; Father wouldn&rsquo;t let me turn you
out.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll close it up again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Anne was so interested in the novelty of a new doorway
that she walked through it, and found herself in a dark low
passage which she had never seen before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It leads to the mill,&rsquo; said Bob.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Would you like to go in and see it at work?&nbsp; But
perhaps you have already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only into the ground floor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come all over it.&nbsp; I am practising as grinder, you
know, to help my father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She followed him along the dark passage, in the side of which
he opened a little trap, when she saw a great slimy cavern, where
the long arms of the mill-wheel flung themselves slowly and
distractedly round, and splashing water-drops caught the little
light that strayed into the gloomy place, turning it into stars
and flashes.&nbsp; A cold mist-laden puff of air came into their
faces, and the roar from within made it necessary for Anne to
shout as she said, &lsquo;It is dismal! let us go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob shut the trap, the roar ceased, and they went on to the
inner part of the mill, where the air was warm and nutty, and
pervaded by a fog of flour.&nbsp; Then they ascended the stairs,
and saw the stones lumbering round and round, and the yellow corn
running down through the hopper.&nbsp; They climbed yet further
to the top stage, where the wheat lay in bins, and where long
rays like feelers stretched in from the sun through the little
window, got nearly lost among cobwebs and timber, and completed
their course by marking the opposite wall with a glowing patch of
gold.</p>
<p>In his earnestness as an exhibitor Bob opened the bolter,
which was spinning rapidly round, the result being that a dense
cloud of flour rolled out in their faces, reminding Anne that her
complexion was probably much paler by this time than when she had
entered the mill.&nbsp; She thanked her companion for his
trouble, and said she would now go down.&nbsp; He followed her
with the same deference as hitherto, and with a sudden and
increasing sense that of all cures for his former unhappy passion
this would have been the nicest, the easiest, and the most
effectual, if he had only been fortunate enough to keep her upon
easy terms.&nbsp; But Miss Garland showed no disposition to go
further than accept his services as a guide; she descended to the
open air, shook the flour from her like a bird, and went on into
the garden amid the September sunshine, whose rays lay level
across the blue haze which the earth gave forth.&nbsp; The gnats
were dancing up and down in airy companies, the nasturtium
flowers shone out in groups from the dark hedge over which they
climbed, and the mellow smell of the decline of summer was
exhaled by everything.&nbsp; Bob followed her as far as the gate,
looked after her, thought of her as the same girl who had half
encouraged him years ago, when she seemed so superior to him;
though now they were almost equal she apparently thought him
beneath her.&nbsp; It was with a new sense of pleasure that his
mind flew to the fact that she was now an inmate of his
father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>His obsequious bearing was continued during the next
week.&nbsp; In the busy hours of the day they seldom met, but
they regularly encountered each other at meals, and these
cheerful occasions began to have an interest for him quite
irrespective of dishes and cups.&nbsp; When Anne entered and took
her seat she was always loudly hailed by Miller Loveday as he
whetted his knife; but from Bob she condescended to accept no
such familiar greeting, and they often sat down together as if
each had a blind eye in the direction of the other.&nbsp; Bob
sometimes told serious and correct stories about sea-captains,
pilots, boatswains, mates, able seamen, and other curious fauna
of the marine world; but these were directly addressed to his
father and Mrs. Loveday, Anne being included at the
clinching-point by a glance only.&nbsp; He sometimes opened
bottles of sweet cider for her, and then she thanked him; but
even this did not lead to her encouraging his chat.</p>
<p>One day when Anne was paring an apple she was left at table
with the young man.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have made something for
you,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She looked all over the table; nothing was there save the
ordinary remnants.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O I don&rsquo;t mean that it is here; it is out by the
bridge at the mill-head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He arose, and Anne followed with curiosity in her eyes, and
with her firm little mouth pouted up to a puzzled shape.&nbsp; On
reaching the mossy mill-head she found that he had fixed in the
keen damp draught which always prevailed over the wheel an
&AElig;olian harp of large size.&nbsp; At present the strings
were partly covered with a cloth.&nbsp; He lifted it, and the
wires began to emit a weird harmony which mingled curiously with
the plashing of the wheel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I made it on purpose for you, Miss Garland,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>She thanked him very warmly, for she had never seen anything
like such an instrument before, and it interested her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It was very thoughtful of you to make it,&rsquo; she
added.&nbsp; &lsquo;How came you to think of such a
thing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O I don&rsquo;t know exactly,&rsquo; he replied, as if
he did not care to be questioned on the point.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have never made one in my life till now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Every night after this, during the mournful gales of autumn,
the strange mixed music of water, wind, and strings met her ear,
swelling and sinking with an almost supernatural cadence.&nbsp;
The character of the instrument was far enough removed from
anything she had hitherto seen of Bob&rsquo;s hobbies; so that
she marvelled pleasantly at the new depths of poetry this
contrivance revealed as existent in that young seaman&rsquo;s
nature, and allowed her emotions to flow out yet a little further
in the old direction, notwithstanding her late severe resolve to
bar them back.</p>
<p>One breezy night, when the mill was kept going into the small
hours, and the wind was exactly in the direction of the
water-current, the music so mingled with her dreams as to wake
her: it seemed to rhythmically set itself to the words,
&lsquo;Remember me! think of me!&rsquo;&nbsp; She was much
impressed; the sounds were almost too touching; and she spoke to
Bob the next morning on the subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How strange it is that you should have thought of
fixing that harp where the water gushes!&rsquo; she gently
observed.&nbsp; &lsquo;It affects me almost painfully at
night.&nbsp; You are poetical, Captain Bob.&nbsp; But it is
too&mdash;too sad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will take it away,&rsquo; said Captain Bob
promptly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It certainly is too sad; I thought so
myself.&nbsp; I myself was kept awake by it one night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How came you to think of making such a peculiar
thing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Bob, &lsquo;it is hardly worth saying
why.&nbsp; It is not a good place for such a queer noisy machine;
and I&rsquo;ll take it away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On second thoughts,&rsquo; said Anne, &lsquo;I should
like it to remain a little longer, because it sets me
thinking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of me?&rsquo; he asked with earnest frankness.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s colour rose fast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes,&rsquo; she said, trying to infuse much plain
matter-of-fact into her voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course I am led to
think of the person who invented it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob seemed unaccountably embarrassed, and the subject was not
pursued.&nbsp; About half-an-hour later he came to her again,
with something of an uneasy look.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was a little matter I didn&rsquo;t tell you just
now, Miss Garland,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;About that harp
thing, I mean.&nbsp; I did make it, certainly, but it was my
brother John who asked me to do it, just before he went
away.&nbsp; John is very musical, as you know, and he said it
would interest you; but as he didn&rsquo;t ask me to tell, I did
not.&nbsp; Perhaps I ought to have, and not have taken the credit
to myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, it is nothing!&rsquo; said Anne quickly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is a very incomplete instrument after all, and it will
be just as well for you to take it away as you first
proposed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said that he would, but he forgot to do it that day; and
the following night there was a high wind, and the harp cried and
moaned so movingly that Anne, whose window was quite near, could
hardly bear the sound with its new associations.&nbsp; John
Loveday was present to her mind all night as an ill-used man; and
yet she could not own that she had ill-used him.</p>
<p>The harp was removed next day.&nbsp; Bob, feeling that his
credit for originality was damaged in her eyes, by way of
recovering it set himself to paint the summer-house which Anne
frequented, and when he came out he assured her that it was quite
his own idea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wanted doing, certainly,&rsquo; she said, in a
neutral tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is just about troublesome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; you can&rsquo;t quite reach up.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
because you are not very tall; is it not, Captain
Loveday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You never used to say things like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I don&rsquo;t mean that you are much less than
tall!&nbsp; Shall I hold the paint for you, to save your stepping
down?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, if you would.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took the paint-pot, and stood looking at the brush as it
moved up and down in his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope I shall not sprinkle your fingers,&rsquo; he
observed as he dipped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, that would not matter!&nbsp; You do it very
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear that you think so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But perhaps not quite so much art is demanded to paint
a summer-house as to paint a picture?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thinking that, as a painter&rsquo;s daughter, and a person of
education superior to his own, she spoke with a flavour of
sarcasm, he felt humbled and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did not use to talk like that to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was perhaps too young then to take any pleasure in
giving pain,&rsquo; she observed daringly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does it give you pleasure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like to give pain to people who have given pain to
me,&rsquo; she said smartly, without removing her eyes from the
green liquid in her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ask your pardon for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I meant you&mdash;though I did mean
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob looked and looked at her side face till he was bewitched
into putting down his brush.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was that stupid forgetting of &rsquo;ee for a
time!&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I hadn&rsquo;t seen
you for so very long&mdash;consider how many years!&nbsp; O, dear
Anne!&rsquo; he said, advancing to take her hand, &lsquo;how well
we knew one another when we were children!&nbsp; You was a queen
to me then; and so you are now, and always.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Possibly Anne was thrilled pleasantly enough at having brought
the truant village lad to her feet again; but he was not to find
the situation so easy as he imagined, and her hand was not to be
taken yet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very pretty!&rsquo; she said, laughing.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And only six weeks since Miss Johnson left.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Zounds, don&rsquo;t say anything about that!&rsquo;
implored Bob.&nbsp; &lsquo;I swear that I never&mdash;never
deliberately loved her&mdash;for a long time together, that is;
it was a sudden sort of thing, you know.&nbsp; But towards
you&mdash;I have more or less honoured and respectfully loved
you, off and on, all my life.&nbsp; There, that&rsquo;s
true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne retorted quickly&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am willing, off and on, to believe you, Captain
Robert.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t see any good in your making these
solemn declarations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me leave to explain, dear Miss Garland.&nbsp; It
is to get you to be pleased to renew an old promise&mdash;made
years ago&mdash;that you&rsquo;ll think o&rsquo; me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a word of any promise will I repeat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, I won&rsquo;t urge &rsquo;ee to-day.&nbsp;
Only let me beg of you to get over the quite wrong notion you
have of me; and it shall be my whole endeavour to fetch your
gracious favour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne turned away from him and entered the house, whither in
the course of a quarter of an hour he followed her, knocking at
her door, and asking to be let in.&nbsp; She said she was busy;
whereupon he went away, to come back again in a short time and
receive the same answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have finished painting the summer-house for
you,&rsquo; he said through the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot come to see it.&nbsp; I shall be engaged till
supper-time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She heard him breathe a heavy sigh and withdraw, murmuring
something about his bad luck in being cut away from the starn
like this.&nbsp; But it was not over yet.&nbsp; When supper-time
came and they sat down together, she took upon herself to reprove
him for what he had said to her in the garden.</p>
<p>Bob made his forehead express despair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I beg you this one thing,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Just let me know your whole mind.&nbsp; Then I shall have
a chance to confess my faults and mend them, or clear my conduct
to your satisfaction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She answered with quickness, but not loud enough to be heard
by the old people at the other end of the
table&mdash;&lsquo;Then, Captain Loveday, I will tell you one
thing, one fault, that perhaps would have been more proper to my
character than to yours.&nbsp; You are too easily impressed by
new faces, and that gives me a <i>bad opinion</i> of
you&mdash;yes, a <i>bad opinion</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, that&rsquo;s it!&rsquo; said Bob slowly, looking at
her with the intense respect of a pupil for a master, her words
being spoken in a manner so precisely between jest and earnest
that he was in some doubt how they were to be received.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Impressed by new faces.&nbsp; It is wrong, certainly, of
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The popping of a cork, and the pouring out of strong beer by
the miller with a view to giving it a head, were apparently
distractions sufficient to excuse her in not attending further to
him; and during the remainder of the sitting her gentle chiding
seemed to be sinking seriously into his mind.&nbsp; Perhaps her
own heart ached to see how silent he was; but she had always
meant to punish him.&nbsp; Day after day for two or three weeks
she preserved the same demeanour, with a self-control which did
justice to her character.&nbsp; And, on his part, considering
what he had to put up with&mdash;how she eluded him, snapped him
off, refused to come out when he called her, refused to see him
when he wanted to enter the little parlour which she had now
appropriated to her private use, his patience testified strongly
to his good-humour.</p>
<h2>XXIII.&nbsp; MILITARY PREPARATIONS ON AN EXTENDED SCALE</h2>
<p>Christmas had passed.&nbsp; Dreary winter with dark evenings
had given place to more dreary winter with light evenings.&nbsp;
Rapid thaws had ended in rain, rain in wind, wind in dust.&nbsp;
Showery days had come&mdash;the season of pink dawns and white
sunsets; and people hoped that the March weather was over.</p>
<p>The chief incident that concerned the household at the mill
was that the miller, following the example of all his neighbours,
had become a volunteer, and duly appeared twice a week in a red,
long-tailed military coat, pipe-clayed breeches, black cloth
gaiters, a heel-balled helmet-hat, with a tuft of green wool, and
epaulettes of the same colour and material.&nbsp; Bob still
remained neutral.&nbsp; Not being able to decide whether to enrol
himself as a sea-fencible, a local militia-man, or a volunteer,
he simply went on dancing attendance upon Anne.&nbsp; Mrs.
Loveday had become awake to the fact that the pair of young
people stood in a curious attitude towards each other; but as
they were never seen with their heads together, and scarcely ever
sat even in the same room, she could not be sure what their
movements meant.</p>
<p>Strangely enough (or perhaps naturally enough), since entering
the Loveday family herself, she had gradually grown to think less
favourably of Anne doing the same thing, and reverted to her
original idea of encouraging Festus; this more particularly
because he had of late shown such perseverance in haunting the
precincts of the mill, presumably with the intention of lighting
upon the young girl.&nbsp; But the weather had kept her mostly
indoors.</p>
<p>One afternoon it was raining in torrents.&nbsp; Such leaves as
there were on trees at this time of year&mdash;those of the
laurel and other evergreens&mdash;staggered beneath the hard
blows of the drops which fell upon them, and afterwards could be
seen trickling down the stems beneath and silently entering the
ground.&nbsp; The surface of the mill-pond leapt up in a thousand
spirts under the same downfall, and clucked like a hen in the
rat-holes along the banks as it undulated under the wind.&nbsp;
The only dry spot visible from the front windows of the
mill-house was the inside of a small shed, on the opposite side
of the courtyard.&nbsp; While Mrs. Loveday was noticing the
threads of rain descending across its interior shade, Festus
Derriman walked up and entered it for shelter, which, owing to
the lumber within, it but scantily afforded to a man who would
have been a match for one of Frederick William&rsquo;s
Patagonians.</p>
<p>It was an excellent opportunity for helping on her
scheme.&nbsp; Anne was in the back room, and by asking him in
till the rain was over she would bring him face to face with her
daughter, whom, as the days went on, she increasingly wished to
marry other than a Loveday, now that the romance of her own
alliance with the millet had in some respects worn off.&nbsp; She
was better provided for than before; she was not unhappy; but the
plain fact was that she had married beneath her.&nbsp; She
beckoned to Festus through the window-pane; he instantly complied
with her signal, having in fact placed himself there on purpose
to be noticed; for he knew that Miss Garland would not be
out-of-doors on such a day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good afternoon, Mrs. Loveday,&rsquo; said Festus on
entering.&nbsp; &lsquo;There now&mdash;if I didn&rsquo;t think
that&rsquo;s how it would be!&rsquo;&nbsp; His voice had suddenly
warmed to anger, for he had seen a door close in the back part of
the room, a lithe figure having previously slipped through.</p>
<p>Mrs. Loveday turned, observed that Anne was gone, and said,
&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; as if she did not know.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, nothing, nothing!&rsquo; said Festus crossly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You know well enough what it is, ma&rsquo;am; only you
make pretence otherwise.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll bring her to book
yet.&nbsp; You shall drop your haughty airs, my charmer!&nbsp;
She little thinks I have kept an account of &rsquo;em
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you must treat her politely, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Loveday, secretly pleased at these signs of uncontrollable
affection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me of politeness or generosity,
ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; She is more than a match for me.&nbsp; She
regularly gets over me.&nbsp; I have passed by this house
five-and-fifty times since last Martinmas, and this is all my
reward for&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you will stay till the rain is over,
sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind rain.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m off
again.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got somebody else in her
eye!&rsquo;&nbsp; And the yeoman went out, slamming the door.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the slippery object of his hopes had gone along the
dark passage, passed the trap which opened on the wheel, and
through the door into the mill, where she was met by Bob, who
looked up from the flour-shoot inquiringly and said, &lsquo;You
want me, Miss Garland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I only want to be
allowed to stand here a few minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her to know if she meant it, and finding that she
did, returned to his post.&nbsp; When the mill had rumbled on a
little longer he came back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bob,&rsquo; she said, when she saw him move,
&lsquo;remember that you are at work, and have no time to stand
close to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He bowed and went to his original post again, Anne watching
from the window till Festus should leave.&nbsp; The mill rumbled
on as before, and at last Bob came to her for the third
time.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, Bob&mdash;&rsquo; she began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On my honour, &rsquo;tis only to ask a question.&nbsp;
Will you walk with me to church next Sunday afternoon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I will,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; But at this
moment the yeoman left the house, and Anne, to escape further
parley, returned to the dwelling by the way she had come.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon arrived, and the family was standing at the
door waiting for the church bells to begin.&nbsp; From that side
of the house they could see southward across a paddock to the
rising ground further ahead, where there grew a large elm-tree,
beneath whose boughs footpaths crossed in different directions,
like meridians at the pole.&nbsp; The tree was old, and in summer
the grass beneath it was quite trodden away by the feet of the
many trysters and idlers who haunted the spot.&nbsp; The tree
formed a conspicuous object in the surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>While they looked, a foot soldier in red uniform and white
breeches came along one of the paths, and stopping beneath the
elm, took from his pocket a paper, which he proceeded to nail up
by the four corners to the trunk.&nbsp; He drew back, looked at
it, and went on his way.&nbsp; Bob got his glass from indoors and
levelled it at the placard, but after looking for a long time he
could make out nothing but a lion and a unicorn at the top.&nbsp;
Anne, who was ready for church, moved away from the door, though
it was yet early, and showed her intention of going by way of the
elm.&nbsp; The paper had been so impressively nailed up that she
was curious to read it even at this theological time.&nbsp; Bob
took the opportunity of following, and reminded her of her
promise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then walk behind me not at all close,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied, immediately dropping
behind.</p>
<p>The ludicrous humility of his manner led her to add playfully
over her shoulder, &lsquo;It serves you right, you
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I deserve anything, but I must take the liberty to say
that I hope my behaviour about Matil&mdash;, in forgetting you
awhile, will not make ye wish to keep me <i>always</i>
behind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She replied confidentially, &lsquo;Why I am so earnest not to
be seen with you is that I may appear to people to be independent
of you.&nbsp; Knowing what I do of your weaknesses I can do no
otherwise.&nbsp; You must be schooled into&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Anne,&rsquo; sighed Bob, &lsquo;you hit me
hard&mdash;too hard!&nbsp; If ever I do win you I am sure I shall
have fairly earned you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not what you once seemed to be,&rsquo; she
returned softly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite like to let
myself love you.&rsquo;&nbsp; The last words were not very
audible, and as Bob was behind he caught nothing of them, nor did
he see how sentimental she had become all of a sudden.&nbsp; They
walked the rest of the way in silence, and coming to the tree
read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>ADDRESS TO ALL RANKS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF
ENGLISHMEN.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Friends and Countrymen</span>,&mdash;The
French are now assembling the largest force that ever was
prepared to invade this Kingdom, with the professed purpose of
effecting our complete Ruin and Destruction.&nbsp; They do not
disguise their intentions, as they have often done to other
Countries; but openly boast that they will come over in such
Numbers as cannot be resisted.</p>
<p>Wherever the French have lately appeared they have spared
neither Rich nor Poor, Old nor Young; but like a Destructive
Pestilence have laid waste and destroyed every Thing that before
was fair and flourishing.</p>
<p>On this occasion no man&rsquo;s service is compelled, but you
are invited voluntarily to come forward in defence of everything
that is dear to you, by entering your Names on the Lists which
are sent to the Tything-man of every Parish, and engaging to act
either as <i>Associated Volunteers bearing Arms</i>, <i>as
Pioneers and Labourers</i>, or as <i>Drivers of Waggons</i>.</p>
<p>As Associated Volunteers you will be called out only once a
week, unless the actual Landing of the Enemy should render your
further Services necessary.</p>
<p>As Pioneers or Labourers you will be employed in Breaking up
Roads to hinder the Enemy&rsquo;s advance.</p>
<p>Those who have Pickaxes, Spades, Shovels, Bill-hooks, or other
Working Implements, are desired to mention them to the Constable
or Tything-man of their Parish, in order that they may be entered
on the Lists opposite their Homes, to be used if necessary. . .
.</p>
<p>It is thought desirable to give you this Explanation, that you
may not be ignorant of the Duties to which you may be
called.&nbsp; But if the love of true Liberty and honest Fame has
not ceased to animate the Hearts of Englishmen, Pay, though
necessary, will be the least Part of your Reward.&nbsp; You will
find your best Recompense in having done your Duty to your King
and Country by driving back or destroying your old and implacable
Enemy, envious of your Freedom and Happiness, and therefore
seeking to destroy them; in having protected your Wives and
Children from Death, or worse than Death, which will follow the
Success of such Inveterate Foes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rouse</span>, therefore, and unite as one
man in the best of Causes!&nbsp; United we may defy the World to
conquer us; but Victory will never belong to those who are
slothful and unprepared. <a name="citation207"></a><a
href="#footnote207" class="citation">[207]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I must go and join at once!&rsquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>Anne turned to him, all the playfulness gone from her
face.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish we lived in the north of England, Bob,
so as to be further away from where he&rsquo;ll land!&rsquo; she
murmured uneasily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where we are would be Paradise to me, if you would only
make it so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not right to talk so lightly at such a serious
time,&rsquo; she thoughtfully returned, going on towards the
church.</p>
<p>On drawing near, they saw through the boughs of a clump of
intervening trees, still leafless, but bursting into buds of
amber hue, a glittering which seemed to be reflected from points
of steel.&nbsp; In a few moments they heard above the tender
chiming of the church bells the loud voice of a man giving words
of command, at which all the metallic points suddenly shifted
like the bristles of a porcupine, and glistened anew.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the drilling,&rsquo; said Loveday.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They drill now between the services, you know, because
they can&rsquo;t get the men together so readily in the
week.&nbsp; It makes me feel that I ought to be doing more than I
am!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they had passed round the belt of trees, the company of
recruits became visible, consisting of the able-bodied
inhabitants of the hamlets thereabout, more or less known to Bob
and Anne.&nbsp; They were assembled on the green plot outside the
churchyard-gate, dressed in their common clothes, and the
sergeant who had been putting them through their drill was the
man who nailed up the proclamation.&nbsp; He was now engaged in
untying a canvas money-bag, from which he drew forth a handful of
shillings, giving one to each man in payment for his
attendance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Men, I dismissed ye too soon&mdash;parade, parade
again, I say,&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;My watch is fast, I
find.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s another twenty minutes afore the
worship of God commences.&nbsp; Now all of you that
ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got firelocks, fall in at the lower end.&nbsp;
Eyes right and dress!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As every man was anxious to see how the rest stood, those at
the end of the line pressed forward for that purpose, till the
line assumed the form of a bow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look at ye now!&nbsp; Why, you are all a crooking
in!&nbsp; Dress, dress!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They dressed forthwith; but impelled by the same motive they
soon resumed their former figure, and so they were despairingly
permitted to remain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I hope you&rsquo;ll have a little patience,&rsquo;
said the sergeant, as he stood in the centre of the arc,
&lsquo;and pay strict attention to the word of command, just
exactly as I give it out to ye; and if I should go wrong, I shall
be much obliged to any friend who&rsquo;ll put me right again,
for I have only been in the army three weeks myself, and we are
all liable to mistakes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So we be, so we be,&rsquo; said the line heartily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tention, the whole, then.&nbsp; Poise
fawlocks!&nbsp; Very well done!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, what must we do that haven&rsquo;t got no
firelocks!&rsquo; said the lower end of the line in a helpless
voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, was ever such a question!&nbsp; Why, you must do
nothing at all, but think <i>how</i> you&rsquo;d poise &rsquo;em
<i>if</i> you had &rsquo;em.&nbsp; You middle men, that are armed
with hurdle-sticks and cabbage-stumps just to make-believe, must
of course use &rsquo;em as if they were the real thing.&nbsp; Now
then, cock fawlocks!&nbsp; Present!&nbsp; Fire! (Pretend to, I
mean, and the same time throw yer imagination into the field
o&rsquo; battle.)&nbsp; Very good&mdash;very good indeed; except
that some of you were a <i>little</i> too soon, and the rest a
<i>little</i> too late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, sergeant, can I fall out, as I am master-player
in the choir, and my bass-viol strings won&rsquo;t stand at this
time o&rsquo; year, unless they be screwed up a little before the
passon comes in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you think of such trifles as churchgoing at
such a time as this, when your own native country is on the point
of invasion?&rsquo; said the sergeant sternly.&nbsp; &lsquo;And,
as you know, the drill ends three minutes afore church begins,
and that&rsquo;s the law, and it wants a quarter of an hour
yet.&nbsp; Now, at the word <i>Prime</i>, shake the powder
(supposing you&rsquo;ve got it) into the priming-pan, three last
fingers behind the rammer; then shut your pans, drawing your
right arm nimble-like towards your body.&nbsp; I ought to have
told ye before this, that at <i>Hand your katridge</i>, seize it
and bring it with a quick motion to your mouth, bite the top well
off, and don&rsquo;t swaller so much of the powder as to make ye
hawk and spet instead of attending to your drill.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s that man a-saying of in the rear rank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, sir, &rsquo;tis Anthony Cripplestraw, wanting
to know how he&rsquo;s to bite off his katridge, when he
haven&rsquo;t a tooth left in &rsquo;s head?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Man!&nbsp; Why, what&rsquo;s your genius for war?&nbsp;
Hold it up to your right-hand man&rsquo;s mouth, to be sure, and
let him nip it off for ye.&nbsp; Well, what have you to say,
Private Tremlett?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ye understand
English?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ask yer pardon, sergeant; but what must we infantry of
the awkward squad do if Boney comes afore we get our
firelocks?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take a pike, like the rest of the incapables.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll find a store of them ready in the corner of the
church tower.&nbsp; Now
then&mdash;Shoulder&mdash;r&mdash;r&mdash;r&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, they be tinging in the passon!&rsquo; exclaimed
David, Miller Loveday&rsquo;s man, who also formed one of the
company, as the bells changed from chiming all three together to
a quick beating of one.&nbsp; The whole line drew a breath of
relief, threw down their arms, and began running off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I must dismiss ye,&rsquo; said the
sergeant.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come back&mdash;come back!&nbsp; Next
drill is Tuesday afternoon at four.&nbsp; And, mind, if your
masters won&rsquo;t let ye leave work soon enough, tell me, and
I&rsquo;ll write a line to Gover&rsquo;ment!&nbsp;
&lsquo;Tention!&nbsp; To the right&mdash;left wheel, I
mean&mdash;no, no&mdash;right wheel.&nbsp;
Mar&mdash;r&mdash;r&mdash;rch!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some wheeled to the right and some to the left, and some
obliging men, including Cripplestraw, tried to wheel both
ways.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop, stop; try again!&nbsp; &lsquo;Cruits and
comrades, unfortunately when I&rsquo;m in a hurry I can never
remember my right hand from my left, and never could as a
boy.&nbsp; You must excuse me, please.&nbsp; Practice makes
perfect, as the saying is; and, much as I&rsquo;ve learnt since I
&lsquo;listed, we always find something new.&nbsp; Now then,
right wheel! march! halt!&nbsp; Stand at ease! dismiss!&nbsp; I
think that&rsquo;s the order o&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;ll look in
the Gover&rsquo;ment book afore Tuesday.&rsquo; <a

class="citation">[211]</a></p>
<p>Many of the company who had been drilled preferred to go off
and spend their shillings instead of entering the church; but
Anne and Captain Bob passed in.&nbsp; Even the interior of the
sacred edifice was affected by the agitation of the times.&nbsp;
The religion of the country had, in fact, changed from love of
God to hatred of Napoleon Buonaparte; and, as if to remind the
devout of this alteration, the pikes for the pikemen (all those
accepted men who were not otherwise armed) were kept in the
church of each parish.&nbsp; There, against the wall, they always
stood&mdash;a whole sheaf of them, formed of new ash stems, with
a spike driven in at one end, the stick being preserved from
splitting by a ferule.&nbsp; And there they remained, year after
year, in the corner of the aisle, till they were removed and
placed under the gallery stairs, and thence ultimately to the
belfry, where they grew black, rusty, and worm-eaten, and were
gradually stolen and carried off by sextons, parish clerks,
whitewashers, window-menders, and other church servants for use
at home as rake-stems, benefit-club staves, and pick-handles, in
which degraded situations they may still occasionally be
found.</p>
<p>But in their new and shining state they had a terror for Anne,
whose eyes were involuntarily drawn towards them as she sat at
Bob&rsquo;s side during the service, filling her with bloody
visions of their possible use not far from the very spot on which
they were now assembled.&nbsp; The sermon, too, was on the
subject of patriotism; so that when they came out she began to
harp uneasily upon the probability of their all being driven from
their homes.</p>
<p>Bob assured her that with the sixty thousand regulars, the
militia reserve of a hundred and twenty thousand, and the three
hundred thousand volunteers, there was not much to fear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I sometimes have a fear that poor John will be
killed,&rsquo; he continued after a pause.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is
sure to be among the first that will have to face the invaders,
and the trumpeters get picked off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is the same chance for him as for the
others,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;the same chance, such as it
is.&nbsp; You have never liked John since that affair of Matilda
Johnson, have you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; she quickly asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Bob timidly, &lsquo;as it is a
ticklish time for him, would it not be worth while to make up any
differences before the crash comes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have nothing to make up,&rsquo; said Anne, with some
distress.&nbsp; She still fully believed the trumpet-major to
have smuggled away Miss Johnson because of his own interest in
that lady, which must have made his professions to herself a mere
pastime; but that very conduct had in it the curious advantage to
herself of setting Bob free.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since John has been gone,&rsquo; continued her
companion, &lsquo;I have found out more of his meaning, and of
what he really had to do with that woman&rsquo;s flight.&nbsp;
Did you know that he had anything to do with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That he got her to go away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Bob with surprise.&nbsp; He was not exasperated
with John, and yet he knew so much as this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;what did it
mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not explain to her then; but the possibility of
John&rsquo;s death, which had been newly brought home to him by
the military events of the day, determined him to get poor
John&rsquo;s character cleared.&nbsp; Reproaching himself for
letting her remain so long with a mistaken idea of him, Bob went
to his father as soon as they got home, and begged him to get
Mrs. Loveday to tell Anne the true reason of John&rsquo;s
objection to Miss Johnson as a sister-in-law.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She thinks it is because they were old lovers new met,
and that he wants to marry her,&rsquo; he exclaimed to his father
in conclusion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the meaning of the split
between Miss Nancy and Jack,&rsquo; said the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, were they any more than common friends?&rsquo;
asked Bob uneasily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not on her side, perhaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we must do it,&rsquo; replied Bob, painfully
conscious that common justice to John might bring them into
hazardous rivalry, yet determined to be fair.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell
it all to Mrs. Loveday, and get her to tell Anne.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>XXIV.&nbsp; A LETTER, A VISITOR, AND A TIN BOX</h2>
<p>The result of the explanation upon Anne was bitter
self-reproach.&nbsp; She was so sorry at having wronged the
kindly soldier that next morning she went by herself to the down,
and stood exactly where his tent had covered the sod on which he
had lain so many nights, thinking what sadness he must have
suffered because of her at the time of packing up and going
away.&nbsp; After that she wiped from her eyes the tears of pity
which had come there, descended to the house, and wrote an
impulsive letter to him, in which occurred the following
passages, indiscreet enough under the circumstances:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I find all justice, all rectitude, on your
side, John; and all impertinence, all inconsiderateness, on
mine.&nbsp; I am so much convinced of your honour in the whole
transaction, that I shall for the future mistrust myself in
everything.&nbsp; And if it be possible, whenever I differ from
you on any point I shall take an hour&rsquo;s time for
consideration before I say that I differ.&nbsp; If I have lost
your friendship, I have only myself to thank for it; but I
sincerely hope that you can forgive.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After writing this she went to the garden, where Bob was
shearing the spring grass from the paths.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is
John&rsquo;s direction?&rsquo; she said, holding the sealed
letter in her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exonbury Barracks,&rsquo; Bob faltered, his countenance
sinking.</p>
<p>She thanked him and went indoors.&nbsp; When he came in, later
in the day, he passed the door of her empty sitting-room and saw
the letter on the mantelpiece.&nbsp; He disliked the sight of
it.&nbsp; Hearing voices in the other room, he entered and found
Anne and her mother there, talking to Cripplestraw, who had just
come in with a message from Squire Derriman, requesting Miss
Garland, as she valued the peace of mind of an old and troubled
man, to go at once and see him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot go,&rsquo; she said, not liking the risk that
such a visit involved.</p>
<p>An hour later Cripplestraw shambled again into the passage, on
the same errand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maister&rsquo;s very poorly, and he hopes that
you&rsquo;ll come, Mis&rsquo;ess Anne.&nbsp; He wants to see
&rsquo;ee very particular about the French.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne would have gone in a moment, but for the fear that some
one besides the farmer might encounter her, and she answered as
before.</p>
<p>Another hour passed, and the wheels of a vehicle were
heard.&nbsp; Cripplestraw had come for the third time, with a
horse and gig; he was dressed in his best clothes, and brought
with him on this occasion a basket containing raisins, almonds,
oranges, and sweet cakes.&nbsp; Offering them to her as a gift
from the old farmer, he repeated his request for her to accompany
him, the gig and best mare having been sent as an additional
inducement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe the old gentleman is in love with you,
Anne,&rsquo; said her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t he drive down himself to see
me?&rsquo; Anne inquired of Cripplestraw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He wants you at the house, please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Mr. Festus with him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; he&rsquo;s away to Budmouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I may come and meet you?&rsquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s my letter&mdash;what shall I do about
that?&rsquo; she said, instead of answering him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Take my letter to the post-office, and you may
come,&rsquo; she added.</p>
<p>He said yes and went out, Cripplestraw retreating to the door
till she should be ready.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What letter is it?&rsquo; said her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only one to John,&rsquo; said Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
asked him to forgive my suspicions.&nbsp; I could do no
less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you want to marry <i>him</i>?&rsquo; asked Mrs.
Loveday bluntly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well; he will take that letter as an
encouragement.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you see that he will, you
foolish girl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne did see instantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course!&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell Robert that he need not go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went to her room to secure the letter.&nbsp; It was gone
from the mantelpiece, and on inquiry it was found that the
miller, seeing it there, had sent David with it to Budmouth hours
ago.&nbsp; Anne said nothing, and set out for Oxwell Hall with
Cripplestraw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;William,&rsquo; said Mrs. Loveday to the miller when
Anne was gone and Bob had resumed his work in the garden,
&lsquo;did you get that letter sent off on purpose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I did.&nbsp; I wanted to make sure of it.&nbsp;
John likes her, and now &rsquo;twill be made up; and why
shouldn&rsquo;t he marry her?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll start him in
business, if so be she&rsquo;ll have him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she is likely to marry Festus Derriman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want her to marry anybody but
John,&rsquo; said the miller doggedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not if she is in love with Bob, and has been for years,
and he with her?&rsquo; asked his wife triumphantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In love with Bob, and he with her?&rsquo; repeated
Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said she, going off and leaving him
to his reflections.</p>
<p>When Anne reached the hall she found old Mr. Derriman in his
customary chair.&nbsp; His complexion was more ashen, but his
movement in rising at her entrance, putting a chair and shutting
the door behind her, were much the same as usual.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God you&rsquo;ve come, my dear girl,&rsquo; he
said earnestly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t trip across to
read to me now!&nbsp; Why did ye cost me so much to fetch
you?&nbsp; Fie!&nbsp; A horse and gig, and a man&rsquo;s time in
going three times.&nbsp; And what I sent ye cost a good deal in
Budmouth market, now everything is so dear there, and
&rsquo;twould have cost more if I hadn&rsquo;t bought the raisins
and oranges some months ago, when they were cheaper.&nbsp; I tell
you this because we are old friends, and I have nobody else to
tell my troubles to.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t begrudge anything to
ye since you&rsquo;ve come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not much pleased to come, even now,&rsquo; said
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;What can make you so seriously anxious to see
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you be a good girl and true; and I&rsquo;ve been
thinking that of all people of the next generation that I can
trust, you are the best.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my bonds and my
title-deeds, such as they be, and the leases, you know, and a few
guineas in packets, and more than these, my will, that I have to
speak about.&nbsp; Now do ye come this way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, such things as those!&rsquo; she returned, with
surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand those things at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to understand.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
just this.&nbsp; The French will be here within two months;
that&rsquo;s certain.&nbsp; I have it on the best authority, that
the army at Boulogne is ready, the boats equipped, the plans
laid, and the First Consul only waits for a tide.&nbsp; Heaven
knows what will become o&rsquo; the men o&rsquo; these
parts!&nbsp; But most likely the women will he spared.&nbsp; Now
I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He led her across the hall to a stone staircase of
semi-circular plan, which conducted to the cellars.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Down here?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I must trouble ye to come down here.&nbsp; I have
thought and thought who is the woman that can best keep a secret
for six months, and I say, &ldquo;Anne Garland.&rdquo;&nbsp; You
won&rsquo;t be married before then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no!&rsquo; murmured the young woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t expect ye to keep a close tongue after
such a thing as that.&nbsp; But it will not be
necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the bottom of the steps he struck a light
from a tinder-box, and unlocked the middle one of three doors
which appeared in the whitewashed wall opposite.&nbsp; The rays
of the candle fell upon the vault and sides of a long low cellar,
littered with decayed woodwork from other parts of the hall,
among the rest stair-balusters, carved finials, tracery panels,
and wainscoting.&nbsp; But what most attracted her eye was a
small flagstone turned up in the middle of the floor, a heap of
earth beside it, and a measuring-tape.&nbsp; Derriman went to the
corner of the cellar, and pulled out a clamped box from under the
straw.&nbsp; &lsquo;You be rather heavy, my dear, eh?&rsquo; he
said, affectionately addressing the box as he lifted it.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But you are going to be put in a safe place, you know, or
that rascal will get hold of ye, and carry ye off and ruin
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then with some difficulty lowered the box
into the hole, raked in the earth upon it, and lowered the
flagstone, which he was a long time in fixing to his
satisfaction.&nbsp; Miss Garland, who was romantically
interested, helped him to brush away the fragments of loose
earth; and when he had scattered over the floor a little of the
straw that lay about, they again ascended to upper air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this all, sir?&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just a moment longer, honey.&nbsp; Will you come into
the great parlour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She followed him thither.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If anything happens to me while the fighting is going
on&mdash;it may be on these very fields&mdash;you will know what
to do,&rsquo; he resumed.&nbsp; &lsquo;But first please sit down
again, there&rsquo;s a dear, whilst I write what&rsquo;s in my
head.&nbsp; See, there&rsquo;s the best paper, and a new quill
that I&rsquo;ve afforded myself for&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a strange business!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I
much like it, Mr. Derriman,&rsquo; she said, seating herself.</p>
<p>He had by this time begun to write, and murmured as he
wrote&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Twenty-three and a half from N.W.&nbsp; Sixteen
and three-quarters from N.E.&rdquo;&mdash;There, that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; Now I seal it up and give it to you to keep safe till
I ask ye for it, or you hear of my being trampled down by the
enemy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does it mean?&rsquo; she asked, as she received
the paper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clk!&nbsp; Ha! ha!&nbsp; Why, that&rsquo;s the distance
of the box from the two corners of the cellar.&nbsp; I measured
it before you came.&nbsp; And, my honey, to make all sure, if the
French soldiery are after ye, tell your mother the meaning
on&rsquo;t, or any other friend, in case they should put ye to
death, and the secret be lost.&nbsp; But that I am sure I hope
they won&rsquo;t do, though your pretty face will be a sad bait
to the soldiers.&nbsp; I often have wished you was my daughter,
honey; and yet in these times the less cares a man has the
better, so I am glad you bain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Shall my man drive
you home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she said, much depressed by the words he
had uttered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can find my way.&nbsp; You need not
trouble to come down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then take care of the paper.&nbsp; And if you outlive
me, you&rsquo;ll find I have not forgot you.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>XXV.&nbsp; FESTUS SHOWS HIS LOVE</h2>
<p>Festus Derriman had remained in the Royal watering-place all
that day, his horse being sick at stables; but, wishing to coax
or bully from his uncle a remount for the coming summer, he set
off on foot for Oxwell early in the evening.&nbsp; When he drew
near to the village, or rather to the hall, which was a mile from
the village, he overtook a slim, quick-eyed woman, sauntering
along at a leisurely pace.&nbsp; She was fashionably dressed in a
green spencer, with &lsquo;Mameluke&rsquo; sleeves, and wore a
velvet Spanish hat and feather.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good afternoon t&rsquo;ye, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Festus, throwing a sword-and-pistol air into his greeting.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are out for a walk?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>am</i> out for a walk, captain,&rsquo; said the
lady, who had criticized him from the crevice of her eye, without
seeming to do much more than continue her demure look forward,
and gave the title as a sop to his apparent character.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From the town?&mdash;I&rsquo;d swear it, ma&rsquo;am;
&rsquo;pon my honour I would!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am from the town, sir,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you are a visitor!&nbsp; I know every one of the
regular inhabitants; we soldiers are in and out there
continually.&nbsp; Festus Derriman, Yeomanry Cavalry, you
know.&nbsp; The fact is, the watering-place is under our charge;
the folks will be quite dependent upon us for their deliverance
in the coming struggle.&nbsp; We hold our lives in our hands, and
theirs, I may say, in our pockets.&nbsp; What made you come here,
ma&rsquo;am, at such a critical time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that it is such a critical
time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is, though; and so you&rsquo;d say if you was as
much mixed up with the military affairs of the nation as some of
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lady smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;The King is coming this year,
anyhow,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; said Festus firmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, you
are one of the attendants at court perhaps, come on ahead to get
the King&rsquo;s chambers ready, in case Boney should not
land?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I am connected with the
theatre, though not just at the present moment.&nbsp; I have been
out of luck for the last year or two; but I have fetched up
again.&nbsp; I join the company when they arrive for the
season.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Festus surveyed her with interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;Faith! and is
it so?&nbsp; Well, ma&rsquo;am, what part do you play?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am mostly the leading lady&mdash;the heroine,&rsquo;
she said, drawing herself up with dignity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come and have a look at ye if all&rsquo;s
well, and the landing is put off&mdash;hang me if I
don&rsquo;t!&mdash;Hullo, hullo, what do I see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His eyes were stretched towards a distant field, which Anne
Garland was at that moment hastily crossing, on her way from the
hall to Overcombe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must be off.&nbsp; Good-day to ye, dear
creature!&rsquo; he exclaimed, hurrying forward.</p>
<p>The lady said, &lsquo;O, you droll monster!&rsquo; as she
smiled and watched him stride ahead.</p>
<p>Festus bounded on over the hedge, across the intervening patch
of green, and into the field which Anne was still crossing.&nbsp;
In a moment or two she looked back, and seeing the well-known
Herculean figure of the yeoman behind her felt rather alarmed,
though she determined to show no difference in her outward
carriage.&nbsp; But to maintain her natural gait was beyond her
powers.&nbsp; She spasmodically quickened her pace; fruitlessly,
however, for he gained upon her, and when within a few strides of
her exclaimed, &lsquo;Well, my darling!&rsquo;&nbsp; Anne started
off at a run.</p>
<p>Festus was already out of breath, and soon found that he was
not likely to overtake her.&nbsp; On she went, without turning
her head, till an unusual noise behind compelled her to look
round.&nbsp; His face was in the act of falling back; he swerved
on one side, and dropped like a log upon a convenient
hedgerow-bank which bordered the path.&nbsp; There he lay quite
still.</p>
<p>Anne was somewhat alarmed; and after standing at gaze for two
or three minutes, drew nearer to him, a step and a half at a
time, wondering and doubting, as a meek ewe draws near to some
strolling vagabond who flings himself on the grass near the
flock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is in a swoon!&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>Her heart beat quickly, and she looked around.&nbsp; Nobody
was in sight; she advanced a step nearer still and observed him
again.&nbsp; Apparently his face was turning to a livid hue, and
his breathing had become obstructed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not a swoon; &rsquo;tis apoplexy!&rsquo; she
said, in deep distress.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ought to untie his
neck.&rsquo;&nbsp; But she was afraid to do this, and only drew a
little closer still.</p>
<p>Miss Garland was now within three feet of him, whereupon the
senseless man, who could hold his breath no longer, sprang to his
feet and darted at her, saying, &lsquo;Ha! ha! a scheme for a
kiss!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She felt his arm slipping round her neck; but, twirling about
with amazing dexterity, she wriggled from his embrace and ran
away along the field.&nbsp; The force with which she had
extricated herself was sufficient to throw Festus upon the grass,
and by the time that he got upon his legs again she was many
yards off.&nbsp; Uttering a word which was not exactly a
blessing, he immediately gave chase; and thus they ran till Anne
entered a meadow divided down the middle by a brook about six
feet wide.&nbsp; A narrow plank was thrown loosely across at the
point where the path traversed this stream, and when Anne reached
it she at once scampered over.&nbsp; At the other side she turned
her head to gather the probabilities of the situation, which were
that Festus Derriman would overtake her even now.&nbsp; By a
sudden forethought she stooped, seized the end of the plank, and
endeavoured to drag it away from the opposite bank.&nbsp; But the
weight was too great for her to do more than slightly move it,
and with a desperate sigh she ran on again, having lost many
valuable seconds.</p>
<p>But her attempt, though ineffectual in dragging it down, had
been enough to unsettle the little bridge; and when Derriman
reached the middle, which he did half a minute later, the plank
turned over on its edge, tilting him bodily into the river.&nbsp;
The water was not remarkably deep, but as the yeoman fell flat on
his stomach he was completely immersed; and it was some time
before he could drag himself out.&nbsp; When he arose, dripping
on the bank, and looked around, Anne had vanished from the
mead.&nbsp; Then Festus&rsquo;s eyes glowed like carbuncles, and
he gave voice to fearful imprecations, shaking his fist in the
soft summer air towards Anne, in a way that was terrible for any
maiden to behold.&nbsp; Wading back through the stream, he walked
along its bank with a heavy tread, the water running from his
coat-tails, wrists, and the tips of his ears, in silvery
dribbles, that sparkled pleasantly in the sun.&nbsp; Thus he
hastened away, and went round by a by-path to the hall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the author of his troubles was rapidly drawing
nearer to the mill, and soon, to her inexpressible delight, she
saw Bob coming to meet her.&nbsp; She had heard the flounce, and,
feeling more secure from her pursuer, had dropped her pace to a
quick walk.&nbsp; No sooner did she reach Bob than, overcome by
the excitement of the moment, she flung herself into his
arms.&nbsp; Bob instantly enclosed her in an embrace so very
thorough that there was no possible danger of her falling,
whatever degree of exhaustion might have given rise to her
somewhat unexpected action; and in this attitude they silently
remained, till it was borne in upon Anne that the present was the
first time in her life that she had ever been in such a
position.&nbsp; Her face then burnt like a sunset, and she did
not know how to look up at him.&nbsp; Feeling at length quite
safe, she suddenly resolved not to give way to her first impulse
to tell him the whole of what had happened, lest there should be
a dreadful quarrel and fight between Bob and the yeoman, and
great difficulties caused in the Loveday family on her account,
the miller having important wheat transactions with the
Derrimans.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem frightened, dearest Anne,&rsquo; said Bob
tenderly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I saw a man I did
not like the look of, and he was inclined to follow me.&nbsp;
But, worse than that, I am troubled about the French.&nbsp; O
Bob! I am afraid you will be killed, and my mother, and John, and
your father, and all of us hunted down!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I have told you, dear little heart, that it cannot
be.&nbsp; We shall drive &rsquo;em into the sea after a battle or
two, even if they land, which I don&rsquo;t believe they
will.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got ninety sail of the line, and though
it is rather unfortunate that we should have declared war against
Spain at this ticklish time, there&rsquo;s enough for
all.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Bob went into elaborate statistics of the
navy, army, militia, and volunteers, to prolong the time of
holding her.&nbsp; When he had done speaking he drew rather a
heavy sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Bob?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t been yet to offer myself as a
sea-fencible, and I ought to have done it long ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are only one.&nbsp; Surely they can do without
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob shook his head.&nbsp; She arose from her restful position,
her eye catching his with a shamefaced expression of having given
way at last.&nbsp; Loveday drew from his pocket a paper, and
said, as they slowly walked on, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s something to
make us brave and patriotic.&nbsp; I bought it in Budmouth.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t it a stirring picture?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a hieroglyphic profile of Napoleon.&nbsp; The hat
represented a maimed French eagle; the face was ingeniously made
up of human carcases, knotted and writhing together in such
directions as to form a physiognomy; a band, or stock, shaped to
resemble the English Channel, encircled his throat, and seemed to
choke him; his epaulette was a hand tearing a cobweb that
represented the treaty of peace with England; and his ear was a
woman crouching over a dying child. <a name="citation225"></a><a
href="#footnote225" class="citation">[225]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;It is dreadful!&rsquo; said Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t like to see it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had recovered from her emotion, and walked along beside
him with a grave, subdued face.&nbsp; Bob did not like to assume
the privileges of an accepted lover and draw her hand through his
arm; for, conscious that she naturally belonged to a politer
grade than his own, he feared lest her exhibition of tenderness
were an impulse which cooler moments might regret.&nbsp; A
perfect Paul-and-Virginia life had not absolutely set in for him
as yet, and it was not to be hastened by force.&nbsp; When they
had passed over the bridge into the mill-front they saw the
miller standing at the door with a face of concern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since you have been gone,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;a
Government man has been here, and to all the houses, taking down
the numbers of the women and children, and their ages and the
number of horses and waggons that can be mustered, in case they
have to retreat inland, out of the way of the invading
army.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The little family gathered themselves together, all feeling
the crisis more seriously than they liked to express.&nbsp; Mrs.
Loveday thought how ridiculous a thing social ambition was in
such a conjuncture as this, and vowed that she would leave Anne
to love where she would.&nbsp; Anne, too, forgot the little
peculiarities of speech and manner in Bob and his father, which
sometimes jarred for a moment upon her more refined sense, and
was thankful for their love and protection in this looming
trouble.</p>
<p>On going upstairs she remembered the paper which Farmer
Derriman had given her, and searched in her bosom for it.&nbsp;
She could not find it there.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must have left it on
the table,&rsquo; she said to herself.&nbsp; It did not matter;
she remembered every word.&nbsp; She took a pen and wrote a
duplicate, which she put safely away.</p>
<p>But Anne was wrong.&nbsp; She had, after all, placed the paper
where she supposed, and there it ought to have been.&nbsp; But in
escaping from Festus, when he feigned apoplexy, it had fallen out
upon the grass.&nbsp; Five minutes after that event, when pursuer
and pursued were two or three fields ahead, the gaily-dressed
woman whom the yeoman had overtaken, peeped cautiously through
the stile into the corner of the field which had been the scene
of the scramble; and seeing the paper she climbed over, secured
it, loosened the wafer without tearing the sheet, and read the
memorandum within.&nbsp; Unable to make anything of its meaning,
the saunterer put it in her pocket, and, dismissing the matter
from her mind, went on by the by-path which led to the back of
the mill.&nbsp; Here, behind the hedge, she stood and surveyed
the old building for some time, after which she meditatively
turned, and retraced her steps towards the Royal
watering-place.</p>
<h2>XXVI.&nbsp; THE ALARM</h2>
<p>The night which followed was historic and memorable.&nbsp;
Mrs. Loveday was awakened by the boom of a distant gun: she told
the miller, and they listened awhile.&nbsp; The sound was not
repeated, but such was the state of their feelings that Mr.
Loveday went to Bob&rsquo;s room and asked if he had heard
it.&nbsp; Bob was wide awake, looking out of the window; he had
heard the ominous sound, and was inclined to investigate the
matter.&nbsp; While the father and son were dressing they fancied
that a glare seemed to be rising in the sky in the direction of
the beacon hill.&nbsp; Not wishing to alarm Anne and her mother,
the miller assured them that Bob and himself were merely going
out of doors to inquire into the cause of the report, after which
they plunged into the gloom together.&nbsp; A few steps&rsquo;
progress opened up more of the sky, which, as they had thought,
was indeed irradiated by a lurid light; but whether it came from
the beacon or from a more distant point they were unable to
clearly tell.&nbsp; They pushed on rapidly towards higher
ground.</p>
<p>Their excitement was merely of a piece with that of all men at
this critical juncture.&nbsp; Everywhere expectation was at fever
heat.&nbsp; For the last year or two only five-and-twenty miles
of shallow water had divided quiet English homesteads from an
enemy&rsquo;s army of a hundred and fifty thousand men.&nbsp; We
had taken the matter lightly enough, eating and drinking as in
the days of Noe, and singing satires without end.&nbsp; We punned
on Buonaparte and his gunboats, chalked his effigy on
stage-coaches, and published the same in prints.&nbsp; Still,
between these bursts of hilarity, it was sometimes recollected
that England was the only European country which had not
succumbed to the mighty little man who was less than human in
feeling, and more than human in will; that our spirit for
resistance was greater than our strength; and that the Channel
was often calm.&nbsp; Boats built of wood which was greenly
growing in its native forest three days before it was bent as
wales to their sides, were ridiculous enough; but they might be,
after all, sufficient for a single trip between two visible
shores.</p>
<p>The English watched Buonaparte in these preparations, and
Buonaparte watched the English.&nbsp; At the distance of Boulogne
details were lost, but we were impressed on fine days by the
novel sight of a huge army moving and twinkling like a school of
mackerel under the rays of the sun.&nbsp; The regular way of
passing an afternoon in the coast towns was to stroll up to the
signal posts and chat with the lieutenant on duty there about the
latest inimical object seen at sea.&nbsp; About once a week there
appeared in the newspapers either a paragraph concerning some
adventurous English gentleman who had sailed out in a
pleasure-boat till he lay near enough to Boulogne to see
Buonaparte standing on the heights among his marshals; or else
some lines about a mysterious stranger with a foreign accent,
who, after collecting a vast deal of information on our
resources, had hired a boat at a southern port, and vanished with
it towards France before his intention could be divined.</p>
<p>In forecasting his grand venture, Buonaparte postulated the
help of Providence to a remarkable degree.&nbsp; Just at the hour
when his troops were on board the flat-bottomed boats and ready
to sail, there was to be a great fog, that should spread a vast
obscurity over the length and breadth of the Channel, and keep
the English blind to events on the other side.&nbsp; The fog was
to last twenty-four hours, after which it might clear away.&nbsp;
A dead calm was to prevail simultaneously with the fog, with the
twofold object of affording the boats easy transit and dooming
our ships to lie motionless.&nbsp; Thirdly, there was to be a
spring tide, which should combine its manoeuvres with those of
the fog and calm.</p>
<p>Among the many thousands of minor Englishmen whose lives were
affected by these tremendous designs may be numbered our old
acquaintance Corporal Tullidge, who sported the crushed arm, and
poor old Simon Burden, the dazed veteran who had fought at
Minden.&nbsp; Instead of sitting snugly in the settle of the Old
Ship, in the village adjoining Overcombe, they were obliged to
keep watch on the hill.&nbsp; They made themselves as comfortable
as was possible in the circumstances, dwelling in a hut of clods
and turf, with a brick chimney for cooking.&nbsp; Here they
observed the nightly progress of the moon and stars, grew
familiar with the heaving of moles, the dancing of rabbits on the
hillocks, the distant hoot of owls, the bark of foxes from woods
further inland; but saw not a sign of the enemy.&nbsp; As, night
after night, they walked round the two ricks which it was their
duty to fire at a signal&mdash;one being of furze for a quick
flame, the other of turf, for a long, slow radiance&mdash;they
thought and talked of old times, and drank patriotically from a
large wood flagon that was filled every day.</p>
<p>Bob and his father soon became aware that the light was from
the beacon.&nbsp; By the time that they reached the top it was
one mass of towering flame, from which the sparks fell on the
green herbage like a fiery dew; the forms of the two old men
being seen passing and repassing in the midst of it.&nbsp; The
Lovedays, who came up on the smoky side, regarded the scene for a
moment, and then emerged into the light.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who goes there?&rsquo; said Corporal Tullidge,
shouldering a pike with his sound arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, &rsquo;tis
neighbour Loveday!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you get your signal to fire it from the
east?&rsquo; said the miller hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; from Abbotsea Beach.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you are not to go by a coast signal!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chok&rsquo; it all, wasn&rsquo;t the
Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s direction, whenever you see
Rainbarrow&rsquo;s Beacon burn to the nor&rsquo;east&rsquo;ard,
or Haggardon to the nor&rsquo;west&rsquo;ard, or the actual
presence of the enemy on the shore?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But is he here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt o&rsquo;t!&nbsp; The beach light is only just
gone down, and Simon heard the guns even better than
I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hark, hark!&nbsp; I hear &rsquo;em!&rsquo; said
Bob.</p>
<p>They listened with parted lips, the night wind blowing through
Simon Burden&rsquo;s few teeth as through the ruins of
Stonehenge.&nbsp; From far down on the lower levels came the
noise of wheels and the tramp of horses upon the turnpike
road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there must be something in it,&rsquo; said Miller
Loveday gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bob, we&rsquo;ll go home and make
the women-folk safe, and then I&rsquo;ll don my soldier&rsquo;s
clothes and be off.&nbsp; God knows where our company will
assemble!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They hastened down the hill, and on getting into the road
waited and listened again.&nbsp; Travellers began to come up and
pass them in vehicles of all descriptions.&nbsp; It was difficult
to attract their attention in the dim light, but by standing on
the top of a wall which fenced the road Bob was at last seen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; he cried to a butcher
who was flying past in his cart, his wife sitting behind him
without a bonnet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The French have landed!&rsquo; said the man, without
drawing rein.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where?&rsquo; shouted Bob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In West Bay; and all Budmouth is in uproar!&rsquo;
replied the voice, now faint in the distance.</p>
<p>Bob and his father hastened on till they reached their own
house.&nbsp; As they had expected, Anne and her mother, in common
with most of the people, were both dressed, and stood at the door
bonneted and shawled, listening to the traffic on the
neighbouring highway, Mrs. Loveday having secured what money and
small valuables they possessed in a huge pocket which extended
all round her waist, and added considerably to her weight and
diameter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis true enough,&rsquo; said the miller:
&lsquo;he&rsquo;s come!&nbsp; You and Anne and the maid must be
off to Cousin Jim&rsquo;s at King&rsquo;s-Bere, and when you get
there you must do as they do.&nbsp; I must assemble with the
company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I?&rsquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou&rsquo;st better run to the church, and take a pike
before they be all gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The horse was put into the gig, and Mrs. Loveday, Anne, and
the servant-maid were hastily packed into the vehicle, the latter
taking the reins; David&rsquo;s duties as a fighting-man
forbidding all thought of his domestic offices now.&nbsp; Then
the silver tankard, teapot, pair of candlesticks like Ionic
columns, and other articles too large to be pocketed were thrown
into a basket and put up behind.&nbsp; Then came the
leave-taking, which was as sad as it was hurried.&nbsp; Bob
kissed Anne, and there was no affectation in her receiving that
mark of affection as she said through her tears, &lsquo;God bless
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; At last they moved off in the dim light of
dawn, neither of the three women knowing which road they were to
take, but trusting to chance to find it.</p>
<p>As soon as they were out of sight Bob went off for a pike, and
his father, first new-flinting his firelock, proceeded to don his
uniform, pipe-claying his breeches with such cursory haste as to
bespatter his black gaiters with the same ornamental
compound.&nbsp; Finding when he was ready that no bugle had as
yet sounded, he went with David to the cart-house, dragged out
the waggon, and put therein some of the most useful and
easily-handled goods, in case there might be an opportunity for
conveying them away.&nbsp; By the time this was done and the
waggon pushed back and locked in, Bob had returned with his
weapon, somewhat mortified at being doomed to this low form of
defence.&nbsp; The miller gave his son a parting grasp of the
hand, and arranged to meet him at King&rsquo;s-Bere at the first
opportunity if the news were true; if happily false, here at
their own house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bother it all!&rsquo; he exclaimed, looking at his
stock of flints.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got no ammunition: not a blessed
round!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what&rsquo;s the use of going?&rsquo; asked his
son.</p>
<p>The miller paused.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, I&rsquo;ll go,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps somebody will lend me a little if I
get into a hot corner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lend ye a little!&nbsp; Father, you was always so
simple!&rsquo; said Bob reproachfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;I can bagnet a few, anyhow,&rsquo; said the
miller.</p>
<p>The bugle had been blown ere this, and Loveday the father
disappeared towards the place of assembly, his empty
cartridge-box behind him.&nbsp; Bob seized a brace of loaded
pistols which he had brought home from the ship, and, armed with
these and a pike, he locked the door and sallied out again
towards the turnpike road.</p>
<p>By this time the yeomanry of the district were also on the
move, and among them Festus Derriman, who was sleeping at his
uncle&rsquo;s, and had been awakened by Cripplestraw.&nbsp; About
the time when Bob and his father were descending from the beacon
the stalwart yeoman was standing in the stable-yard adjusting his
straps, while Cripplestraw saddled the horse.&nbsp; Festus
clanked up and down, looked gloomily at the beacon, heard the
retreating carts and carriages, and called Cripplestraw to him,
who came from the stable leading the horse at the same moment
that Uncle Benjy peeped unobserved from a mullioned window above
their heads, the distant light of the beacon fire touching up his
features to the complexion of an old brass clock-face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think that before I start, Cripplestraw,&rsquo; said
Festus, whose lurid visage was undergoing a bleaching process
curious to look upon, &lsquo;you shall go on to Budmouth, and
make a bold inquiry whether the cowardly enemy is on shore as
yet, or only looming in the bay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d go in a moment, sir,&rsquo; said the other,
&lsquo;if I hadn&rsquo;t my bad leg again.&nbsp; I should have
joined my company afore this; but they said at last drill that I
was too old.&nbsp; So I shall wait up in the hay-loft for tidings
as soon as I have packed you off, poor gentleman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do such alarms as these, Cripplestraw, ever happen
without foundation?&nbsp; Buonaparte is a wretch, a miserable
wretch, and this may be only a false alarm to disappoint such as
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, sir; O no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But sometimes there are false alarms?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, yes.&nbsp; There was a pretended sally
o&rsquo; gunboats last year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And was there nothing else pretended&mdash;something
more like this, for instance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cripplestraw shook his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I notice yer
modesty, Mr. Festus, in making light of things.&nbsp; But there
never was, sir.&nbsp; You may depend upon it he&rsquo;s
come.&nbsp; Thank God, my duty as a Local don&rsquo;t require me
to go to the front, but only the valiant men like my
master.&nbsp; Ah, if Boney could only see &rsquo;ee now, sir,
he&rsquo;d know too well there is nothing to be got from such a
determined skilful officer but blows and musket-balls!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes.&nbsp; Cripplestraw, if I ride off to Budmouth
and meet &rsquo;em, all my training will be lost.&nbsp; No skill
is required as a forlorn hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True; that&rsquo;s a point, sir.&nbsp; You would
outshine &rsquo;em all, and be picked off at the very beginning
as a too-dangerous brave man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if I stay here and urge on the faint-hearted ones,
or get up into the turret-stair by that gateway, and pop at the
invaders through the loophole, I shouldn&rsquo;t be so completely
wasted, should I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would not, Mr. Derriman.&nbsp; But, as you was
going to say next, the fire in yer veins won&rsquo;t let ye do
that.&nbsp; You are valiant; very good: you don&rsquo;t want to
husband yer valiance at home.&nbsp; The arg&rsquo;ment is
plain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If my birth had been more obscure,&rsquo; murmured the
yeoman, &lsquo;and I had only been in the militia, for instance,
or among the humble pikemen, so much wouldn&rsquo;t have been
expected of me&mdash;of my fiery nature.&nbsp; Cripplestraw, is
there a drop of brandy to be got at in the house?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t feel very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear nephew,&rsquo; said the old gentleman from above,
whom neither of the others had as yet noticed, &lsquo;I
haven&rsquo;t any spirits opened&mdash;so unfortunate!&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s a beautiful barrel of crab-apple cider in draught;
and there&rsquo;s some cold tea from last night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, is he listening?&rsquo; said Festus, staring
up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now I warrant how glad he is to see me forced to
go&mdash;called out of bed without breakfast, and he quite safe,
and sure to escape because he&rsquo;s an old
man!&mdash;Cripplestraw, I like being in the yeomanry cavalry;
but I wish I hadn&rsquo;t been in the ranks; I wish I had been
only the surgeon, to stay in the rear while the bodies are
brought back to him&mdash;I mean, I should have thrown my heart
at such a time as this more into the labour of restoring wounded
men and joining their shattered limbs
together&mdash;u-u-ugh!&mdash;more than I can into causing the
wounds&mdash;I am too humane, Cripplestraw, for the
ranks!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said his companion, depressing his
spirits to a kindred level.&nbsp; &lsquo;And yet, such is fate,
that, instead of joining men&rsquo;s limbs together, you&rsquo;ll
have to get your own joined&mdash;poor young sojer!&mdash;all
through having such a warlike soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; murmured Festus, and paused.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t think how strange I feel here,
Cripplestraw,&rsquo; he continued, laying his hand upon the
centre buttons of his waistcoat.&nbsp; &lsquo;How I do wish I was
only the surgeon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He slowly mounted, and Uncle Benjy, in the meantime, sang to
himself as he looked on, &lsquo;<i>Twen-ty-three and half from
N.W.</i>&nbsp; <i>Six-teen and three-quar-ters from
N.E.</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that old mummy singing?&rsquo; said Festus
savagely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a hymn for preservation from our enemies, dear
nephew,&rsquo; meekly replied the farmer, who had heard the
remark.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Twen-ty-three and half from
N.W</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Festus allowed his horse to move on a few paces, and then
turned again, as if struck by a happy invention.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Cripplestraw,&rsquo; he began, with an artificial laugh,
&lsquo;I am obliged to confess, after all&mdash;I must see
her!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t nature that makes me draw
back&mdash;&rsquo;tis love.&nbsp; I must go and look for
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A woman, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to confess it; but &rsquo;tis a
woman.&nbsp; Strange that I should be drawn so entirely against
my natural wish to rush at &rsquo;em!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cripplestraw, seeing which way the wind blew, found it
advisable to blow in harmony.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, now at last I see,
sir!&nbsp; Spite that few men live that be worthy to command ye;
spite that you could rush on, marshal the troops to victory, as I
may say; but then&mdash;what of it? there&rsquo;s the unhappy
fate of being smit with the eyes of a woman, and you are
unmanned!&nbsp; Maister Derriman, who is himself, when he&rsquo;s
got a woman round his neck like a millstone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is something like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel the case.&nbsp; Be you valiant?&mdash;I know, of
course, the words being a matter of form&mdash;be you valiant, I
ask?&nbsp; Yes, of course.&nbsp; Then don&rsquo;t you waste it in
the open field.&nbsp; Hoard it up, I say, sir, for a higher class
of war&mdash;the defence of yer adorable lady.&nbsp; Think what
you owe her at this terrible time!&nbsp; Now, Maister Derriman,
once more I ask ye to cast off that first haughty wish to rush to
Budmouth, and to go where your mis&rsquo;ess is defenceless and
alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, Cripplestraw, now you put it like
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank ye, thank ye heartily, Maister Derriman.&nbsp; Go
now and hide with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But can I?&nbsp; Now, hang flattery!&mdash;can a man
hide without a stain?&nbsp; Of course I would not hide in any
mean sense; no, not I!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you be in love, &rsquo;tis plain you may, since it
is not your own life, but another&rsquo;s, that you are concerned
for, and you only save your own because it can&rsquo;t be
helped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis true, Cripplestraw, in a sense.&nbsp; But
will it be understood that way?&nbsp; Will they see it as a brave
hiding?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, sir, if you had not been in love I own to ye that
hiding would look queer, but being to save the tears, groans,
fits, swowndings, and perhaps death of a comely young woman, yer
principle is good; you honourably retreat because you be too
gallant to advance.&nbsp; This sounds strange, ye may say, sir;
but it is plain enough to less fiery minds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Festus did for a moment try to uncover his teeth in a natural
smile, but it died away.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cripplestraw, you flatter
me; or do you mean it?&nbsp; Well, there&rsquo;s truth in
it.&nbsp; I am more gallant in going to her than in marching to
the shore.&nbsp; But we cannot be too careful about our good
names, we soldiers.&nbsp; I must not be seen.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cripplestraw opened the hurdle which closed the arch under the
portico gateway, and Festus passed under, Uncle Benjamin singing,
<i>Twen-ty-three and a half from N.W.</i> with a sort of sublime
ecstasy, feeling, as Festus had observed, that his money was
safe, and that the French would not personally molest an old man
in such a ragged, mildewed coat as that he wore, which he had
taken the precaution to borrow from a scarecrow in one of his
fields for the purpose.</p>
<p>Festus rode on full of his intention to seek out Anne, and
under cover of protecting her retreat accompany her to
King&rsquo;s-Bere, where he knew the Lovedays had
relatives.&nbsp; In the lane he met Granny Seamore, who, having
packed up all her possessions in a small basket, was placidly
retreating to the mountains till all should be over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, granny, have ye seen the French?&rsquo; asked
Festus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said, looking up at him through her
brazen spectacles.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I had I shouldn&rsquo;t
ha&rsquo; seed thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faugh!&rsquo; replied the yeoman, and rode on.&nbsp;
Just as he reached the old road, which he had intended merely to
cross and avoid, his countenance fell.&nbsp; Some troops of
regulars, who appeared to be dragoons, were rattling along the
road.&nbsp; Festus hastened towards an opposite gate, so as to
get within the field before they should see him; but, as ill-luck
would have it, as soon as he got inside, a party of six or seven
of his own yeomanry troop were straggling across the same field
and making for the spot where he was.&nbsp; The dragoons passed
without seeing him; but when he turned out into the road again it
was impossible to retreat towards Overcombe village because of
the yeomen.&nbsp; So he rode straight on, and heard them coming
at his heels.&nbsp; There was no other gate, and the highway soon
became as straight as a bowstring.&nbsp; Unable thus to turn
without meeting them, and caught like an eel in a water-pipe,
Festus drew nearer and nearer to the fateful shore.&nbsp; But he
did not relinquish hope.&nbsp; Just ahead there were cross-roads,
and he might have a chance of slipping down one of them without
being seen.&nbsp; On reaching the spot he found that he was not
alone.&nbsp; A horseman had come up the right-hand lane and drawn
rein.&nbsp; It was an officer of the German legion, and seeing
Festus he held up his hand.&nbsp; Festus rode up to him and
saluted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It ist false report!&rsquo; said the officer.</p>
<p>Festus was a man again.&nbsp; He felt that nothing was too
much for him.&nbsp; The officer, after some explanation of the
cause of alarm, said that he was going across to the road which
led by the moor, to stop the troops and volunteers converging
from that direction, upon which Festus offered to give
information along the Casterbridge road.&nbsp; The German crossed
over, and was soon out of sight in the lane, while Festus turned
back upon the way by which he had come.&nbsp; The party of
yeomanry cavalry was rapidly drawing near, and he soon recognized
among them the excited voices of Stubb of Duddle Hole, Noakes of
Muckleford, and other comrades of his orgies at the hall.&nbsp;
It was a magnificent opportunity, and Festus drew his
sword.&nbsp; When they were within speaking distance he reined
round his charger&rsquo;s head to Budmouth and shouted,
&lsquo;On, comrades, on!&nbsp; I am waiting for you.&nbsp; You
have been a long time getting up with me, seeing the glorious
nature of our deeds to-day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well said, Derriman, well said!&rsquo; replied the
foremost of the riders.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you heard anything
new?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only that he&rsquo;s here with his tens of thousands,
and that we are to ride to meet him sword in hand as soon as we
have assembled in the town ahead here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Lord!&rsquo; said Noakes, with a slight falling of
the lower jaw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The man who quails now is unworthy of the name of
yeoman,&rsquo; said Festus, still keeping ahead of the other
troopers and holding up his sword to the sun.&nbsp; &lsquo;O
Noakes, fie, fie!&nbsp; You begin to look pale, man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith, perhaps you&rsquo;d look pale,&rsquo; said
Noakes, with an envious glance upon Festus&rsquo;s daring manner,
&lsquo;if you had a wife and family depending upon ye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take three frog-eating Frenchmen
single-handed!&rsquo; rejoined Derriman, still flourishing his
sword.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have as good swords as you; as you will soon
find,&rsquo; said another of the yeomen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they were three times armed,&rsquo; said
Festus&mdash;&lsquo;ay, thrice three times&mdash;I would attempt
&rsquo;em three to one.&nbsp; How do you feel now, my old friend
Stubb?&rsquo; (turning to another of the warriors.)&nbsp;
&lsquo;O, friend Stubb! no bouncing health to our lady-loves in
Oxwell Hall this summer as last.&nbsp; Eh, Brownjohn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid not,&rsquo; said Brownjohn gloomily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No rattling dinners at Stacie&rsquo;s Hotel, and the
King below with his staff.&nbsp; No wrenching off door-knockers
and sending &rsquo;em to the bakehouse in a pie that nobody calls
for.&nbsp; Weeks of cut-and-thrust work rather!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fight how we may we shan&rsquo;t get rid of the cursed
tyrant before autumn, and many thousand brave men will lie low
before it&rsquo;s done,&rsquo; remarked a young yeoman with a
calm face, who meant to do his duty without much talking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No grinning matches at Mai-dun Castle this
summer,&rsquo; Festus resumed; &lsquo;no thread-the-needle at
Greenhill Fair, and going into shows and driving the showman
crazy with cock-a-doodle-doo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does it make you seem just a trifle uncomfortable,
Noakes?&nbsp; Keep up your spirits, old comrade.&nbsp; Come,
forward! we are only ambling on like so many donkey-women.&nbsp;
We have to get into Budmouth, join the rest of the troop, and
then march along the coast west&rsquo;ard, as I imagine.&nbsp; At
this rate we shan&rsquo;t be well into the thick of battle before
twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Spur on, comrades.&nbsp; No dancing
on the green, Lockham, this year in the moonlight!&nbsp; You was
tender upon that girl; gad, what will become o&rsquo; her in the
struggle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come, Derriman,&rsquo; expostulated
Lockham&mdash;&lsquo;this is all very well, but I don&rsquo;t
care for &lsquo;t.&nbsp; I am as ready to fight as any man,
but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps when you get into battle, Derriman, and see
what it&rsquo;s like, your courage will cool down a
little,&rsquo; added Noakes on the same side, but with secret
admiration of Festus&rsquo;s reckless bravery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be bayoneted first,&rsquo; said Festus.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now let&rsquo;s rally, and on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since Festus was determined to spur on wildly, the rest of the
yeomen did not like to seem behindhand, and they rapidly
approached the town.&nbsp; Had they been calm enough to reflect,
they might have observed that for the last half-hour no carts or
carriages had met them on the way, as they had done further
back.&nbsp; It was not till the troopers reached the turnpike
that they learnt what Festus had known a quarter of an hour
before.&nbsp; At the intelligence Derriman sheathed his sword
with a sigh; and the party soon fell in with comrades who had
arrived there before them, whereupon the source and details of
the alarm were boisterously discussed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, didn&rsquo;t you know of the mistake till
now?&rsquo; asked one of these of the new-comers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, when I was dropping over the hill by the cross-roads
I looked back and saw that man talking to the messenger, and he
must have told him the truth.&rsquo;&nbsp; The speaker pointed to
Festus.&nbsp; They turned their indignant eyes full upon
him.&nbsp; That he had sported with their deepest feelings, while
knowing the rumour to be baseless, was soon apparent to all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beat him black and blue with the flat of our
blades!&rsquo; shouted two or three, turning their horses&rsquo;
heads to drop back upon Derriman, in which move they were
followed by most of the party.</p>
<p>But Festus, foreseeing danger from the unexpected revelation,
had already judiciously placed a few intervening yards between
himself and his fellow-yeomen, and now, clapping spurs to his
horse, rattled like thunder and lightning up the road
homeward.&nbsp; His ready flight added hotness to their pursuit,
and as he rode and looked fearfully over his shoulder he could
see them following with enraged faces and drawn swords, a
position which they kept up for a distance of more than a
mile.&nbsp; Then he had the satisfaction of seeing them drop off
one by one, and soon he and his panting charger remained alone on
the highway.</p>
<h2>XXVII.&nbsp; DANGER TO ANNE</h2>
<p>He stopped and reflected how to turn this rebuff to
advantage.&nbsp; Baulked in his project of entering the
watering-place and enjoying congratulations upon his patriotic
bearing during the advance, he sulkily considered that he might
be able to make some use of his enforced retirement by riding to
Overcombe and glorifying himself in the eyes of Miss Garland
before the truth should have reached that hamlet.&nbsp; Having
thus decided he spurred on in a better mood.</p>
<p>By this time the volunteers were on the march, and as Derriman
ascended the road he met the Overcombe company, in which trudged
Miller Loveday shoulder to shoulder with the other substantial
householders of the place and its neighbourhood, duly equipped
with pouches, cross-belts, firelocks, flint-boxes, pickers,
worms, magazines, priming-horns, heel-ball, and pomatum.&nbsp;
There was nothing to be gained by further suppression of the
truth, and briefly informing them that the danger was not so
immediate as had been supposed, Festus galloped on.&nbsp; At the
end of another mile he met a large number of pikemen, including
Bob Loveday, whom the yeoman resolved to sound upon the
whereabouts of Anne.&nbsp; The circumstances were such as to lead
Bob to speak more frankly than he might have done on reflection,
and he told Festus the direction in which the women had been
sent.&nbsp; Then Festus informed the group that the report of
invasion was false, upon which they all turned to go homeward
with greatly relieved spirits.</p>
<p>Bob walked beside Derriman&rsquo;s horse for some
distance.&nbsp; Loveday had instantly made up his mind to go and
look for the women, and ease their anxiety by letting them know
the good news as soon as possible.&nbsp; But he said nothing of
this to Festus during their return together; nor did Festus tell
Bob that he also had resolved to seek them out, and by
anticipating every one else in that enterprise, make of it a
glorious opportunity for bringing Miss Garland to her senses
about him.&nbsp; He still resented the ducking that he had
received at her hands, and was not disposed to let that insult
pass without obtaining some sort of sweet revenge.</p>
<p>As soon as they had parted Festus cantered on over the hill,
meeting on his way the Longpuddle volunteers, sixty rank and
file, under Captain Cunningham; the Casterbridge company, ninety
strong (known as the &lsquo;Consideration Company&rsquo; in those
days), under Captain Strickland; and others&mdash;all with
anxious faces and covered with dust.&nbsp; Just passing the word
to them and leaving them at halt, he proceeded rapidly onward in
the direction of King&rsquo;s-Bere.&nbsp; Nobody appeared on the
road for some time, till after a ride of several miles he met a
stray corporal of volunteers, who told Festus in answer to his
inquiry that he had certainly passed no gig full of women of the
kind described.&nbsp; Believing that he had missed them by
following the highway, Derriman turned back into a lane along
which they might have chosen to journey for privacy&rsquo;s sake,
notwithstanding the badness and uncertainty of its track.&nbsp;
Arriving again within five miles of Overcombe, he at length heard
tidings of the wandering vehicle and its precious burden, which,
like the Ark when sent away from the country of the Philistines,
had apparently been left to the instincts of the beast that drew
it.&nbsp; A labouring man, just at daybreak, had seen the
helpless party going slowly up a distant drive, which he pointed
out.</p>
<p>No sooner had Festus parted from this informant than he beheld
Bob approaching, mounted on the miller&rsquo;s second and heavier
horse.&nbsp; Bob looked rather surprised, and Festus felt his
coming glory in danger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They went down that lane,&rsquo; he said, signifying
precisely the opposite direction to the true one.&nbsp; &lsquo;I,
too, have been on the look-out for missing friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Festus was riding back there was no reason to doubt his
information, and Loveday rode on as misdirected.&nbsp;
Immediately that he was out of sight Festus reversed his course,
and followed the track which Anne and her companions were last
seen to pursue.</p>
<p>This road had been ascended by the gig in question nearly two
hours before the present moment.&nbsp; Molly, the servant, held
the reins, Mrs. Loveday sat beside her, and Anne behind.&nbsp;
Their progress was but slow, owing partly to Molly&rsquo;s want
of skill, and partly to the steepness of the road, which here
passed over downs of some extent, and was rarely or never
mended.&nbsp; It was an anxious morning for them all, and the
beauties of the early summer day fell upon unheeding eyes.&nbsp;
They were too anxious even for conjecture, and each sat thinking
her own thoughts, occasionally glancing westward, or stopping the
horse to listen to sounds from more frequented roads along which
other parties were retreating.&nbsp; Once, while they listened
and gazed thus, they saw a glittering in the distance, and heard
the tramp of many horses.&nbsp; It was a large body of cavalry
going in the direction of the King&rsquo;s watering-place, the
same regiment of dragoons, in fact, which Festus had seen further
on in its course.&nbsp; The women in the gig had no doubt that
these men were marching at once to engage the enemy.&nbsp; By way
of varying the monotony of the journey Molly occasionally burst
into tears of horror, believing Buonaparte to be in countenance
and habits precisely what the caricatures represented him.&nbsp;
Mrs. Loveday endeavoured to establish cheerfulness by assuring
her companions of the natural civility of the French nation, with
whom unprotected women were safe from injury, unless through the
casual excesses of soldiery beyond control.&nbsp; This was poor
consolation to Anne, whose mind was more occupied with Bob than
with herself, and a miserable fear that she would never again see
him alive so paled her face and saddened her gaze forward, that
at last her mother said, &lsquo;Who was you thinking of, my
dear?&rsquo;&nbsp; Anne&rsquo;s only reply was a look at her
mother, with which a tear mingled.</p>
<p>Molly whipped the horse, by which she quickened his pace for
five yards, when he again fell into the perverse slowness that
showed how fully conscious he was of being the master-mind and
chief personage of the four.&nbsp; Whenever there was a pool of
water by the road he turned aside to drink a mouthful, and
remained there his own time in spite of Molly&rsquo;s tug at the
reins and futile fly-flapping on his rump.&nbsp; They were now in
the chalk district, where there were no hedges, and a rough
attempt at mending the way had been made by throwing down huge
lumps of that glaring material in heaps, without troubling to
spread it or break them abroad.&nbsp; The jolting here was most
distressing, and seemed about to snap the springs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How that wheel do wamble,&rsquo; said Molly at
last.&nbsp; She had scarcely spoken when the wheel came off, and
all three were precipitated over it into the road.</p>
<p>Fortunately the horse stood still, and they began to gather
themselves up.&nbsp; The only one of the three who had suffered
in the least from the fall was Anne, and she was only conscious
of a severe shaking which had half stupefied her for the
time.&nbsp; The wheel lay flat in the road, so that there was no
possibility of driving further in their present plight.&nbsp;
They looked around for help.&nbsp; The only friendly object near
was a lonely cottage, from its situation evidently the home of a
shepherd.</p>
<p>The horse was unharnessed and tied to the back of the gig, and
the three women went across to the house.&nbsp; On getting close
they found that the shutters of all the lower windows were
closed, but on trying the door it opened to the hand.&nbsp;
Nobody was within; the house appeared to have been abandoned in
some confusion, and the probability was that the shepherd had
fled on hearing the alarm.&nbsp; Anne now said that she felt the
effects of her fall too severely to be able to go any further
just then, and it was agreed that she should be left there while
Mrs. Loveday and Molly went on for assistance, the elder lady
deeming Molly too young and vacant-minded to be trusted to go
alone.&nbsp; Molly suggested taking the horse, as the distance
might be great, each of them sitting alternately on his back
while the other led him by the head.&nbsp; This they did, Anne
watching them vanish down the white and lumpy road.</p>
<p>She then looked round the room, as well as she could do so by
the light from the open door.&nbsp; It was plain, from the
shutters being closed, that the shepherd had left his house
before daylight, the candle and extinguisher on the table
pointing to the same conclusion.&nbsp; Here she remained, her
eyes occasionally sweeping the bare, sunny expanse of down, that
was only relieved from absolute emptiness by the overturned gig
hard by.&nbsp; The sheep seemed to have gone away, and scarcely a
bird flew across to disturb the solitude.&nbsp; Anne had risen
early that morning, and leaning back in the withy chair, which
she had placed by the door, she soon fell into an uneasy doze,
from which she was awakened by the distant tramp of a
horse.&nbsp; Feeling much recovered from the effects of the
overturn, she eagerly rose and looked out.&nbsp; The horse was
not Miller Loveday&rsquo;s, but a powerful bay, bearing a man in
full yeomanry uniform.</p>
<p>Anne did not wait to recognize further; instantly re-entering
the house, she shut the door and bolted it.&nbsp; In the dark she
sat and listened: not a sound.&nbsp; At the end of ten minutes,
thinking that the rider if he were not Festus had carelessly
passed by, or that if he were Festus he had not seen her, she
crept softly upstairs and peeped out of the window.&nbsp;
Excepting the spot of shade, formed by the gig as before, the
down was quite bare.&nbsp; She then opened the casement and
stretched out her neck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, young madam!&nbsp; There you are!&nbsp; I knew
&rsquo;ee!&nbsp; Now you are caught!&rsquo; came like a clap of
thunder from a point three or four feet beneath her, and turning
down her frightened eyes she beheld Festus Derriman lurking close
to the wall.&nbsp; His attention had first been attracted by her
shutting the door of the cottage; then by the overturned gig; and
after making sure, by examining the vehicle, that he was not
mistaken in her identity, he had dismounted, led his horse round
to the side, and crept up to entrap her.</p>
<p>Anne started back into the room, and remained still as a
stone.&nbsp; Festus went on&mdash;&lsquo;Come, you must trust to
me.&nbsp; The French have landed.&nbsp; I have been trying to
meet with you every hour since that confounded trick you played
me.&nbsp; You threw me into the water.&nbsp; Faith, it was well
for you I didn&rsquo;t catch ye then!&nbsp; I should have taken a
revenge in a better way than I shall now.&nbsp; I mean to have
that kiss of ye.&nbsp; Come, Miss Nancy; do you
hear?&mdash;&rsquo;Tis no use for you to lurk inside there.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll have to turn out as soon as Boney comes over the
hill&mdash;Are you going to open the door, I say, and speak to me
in a civil way?&nbsp; What do you think I am, then, that you
should barricade yourself against me as if I was a wild beast or
Frenchman?&nbsp; Open the door, or put out your head, or do
something; or &rsquo;pon my soul I&rsquo;ll break in the
door!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It occurred to Anne at this point of the tirade that the best
policy would be to temporize till somebody should return, and she
put out her head and face, now grown somewhat pale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rsquo; said Festus.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now I can talk to you.&nbsp; Come, my dear, will you open
the door?&nbsp; Why should you be afraid of me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not altogether afraid of you; I am safe from the
French here,&rsquo; said Anne, not very truthfully, and anxiously
casting her eyes over the vacant down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then let me tell you that the alarm is false, and that
no landing has been attempted.&nbsp; Now will you open the door
and let me in?&nbsp; I am tired.&nbsp; I have been on horseback
ever since daylight, and have come to bring you the good
tidings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne looked as if she doubted the news.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Festus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I cannot let you in,&rsquo; she murmured, after a
pause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dash my wig, then,&rsquo; he cried, his face flaming
up, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll find a way to get in!&nbsp; Now,
don&rsquo;t you provoke me!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what I am
capable of.&nbsp; I ask you again, will you open the
door?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you wish it?&rsquo; she said faintly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have told you I want to sit down; and I want to ask
you a question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can ask me from where you are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot ask you properly.&nbsp; It is about a serious
matter: whether you will accept my heart and hand.&nbsp; I am not
going to throw myself at your feet; but I ask you to do your duty
as a woman, namely, give your solemn word to take my name as soon
as the war is over and I have time to attend to you.&nbsp; I
scorn to ask it of a haughty hussy who will only speak to me
through a window; however, I put it to you for the last time,
madam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was no sign on the down of anybody&rsquo;s return, and
she said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll think of it, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have thought of it long enough; I want to
know.&nbsp; Will you or won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well; I think I will.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then she
felt that she might be buying personal safety too dearly by
shuffling thus, since he would spread the report that she had
accepted him, and cause endless complication.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I have changed my mind.&nbsp;
I cannot accept you, Mr. Derriman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s how you play with me!&rsquo; he exclaimed,
stamping.&nbsp; &lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; one moment;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the next.&nbsp; Come, you don&rsquo;t know what
you refuse.&nbsp; That old hall is my uncle&rsquo;s own, and he
has nobody else to leave it to.&nbsp; As soon as he&rsquo;s dead
I shall throw up farming and start as a squire.&nbsp; And
now,&rsquo; he added with a bitter sneer, &lsquo;what a fool you
are to hang back from such a chance!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, I don&rsquo;t value it,&rsquo; said
Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you hate him who would make it
yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may not lie in your power to do that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;has the old fellow been telling you his
affairs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why do you mistrust me?&nbsp; Now, after this will
you open the door, and show that you treat me as a friend if you
won&rsquo;t accept me as a lover?&nbsp; I only want to sit and
talk to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne thought she would trust him; it seemed almost impossible
that he could harm her.&nbsp; She retired from the window and
went downstairs.&nbsp; When her hand was upon the bolt of the
door, her mind misgave her.&nbsp; Instead of withdrawing it she
remained in silence where she was, and he began again&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you going to unfasten it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne did not speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, dash my wig, I will get at you!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
tried me beyond endurance.&nbsp; One kiss would have been enough
that day in the mead; now I&rsquo;ll have forty, whether you will
or no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He flung himself against the door; but as it was bolted, and
had in addition a great wooden bar across it, this produced no
effect.&nbsp; He was silent for a moment, and then the terrified
girl heard him attempt the shuttered window.&nbsp; She ran
upstairs and again scanned the down.&nbsp; The yellow gig still
lay in the blazing sunshine, and the horse of Festus stood by the
corner of the garden&mdash;nothing else was to be seen.&nbsp; At
this moment there came to her ear the noise of a sword drawn from
its scabbard; and, peeping over the window-sill, she saw her
tormentor drive his sword between the joints of the shutters, in
an attempt to rip them open.&nbsp; The sword snapped off in his
hand.&nbsp; With an imprecation he pulled out the piece, and
returned the two halves to the scabbard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; he cried, catching sight of the top of
her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis only a joke, you know; but
I&rsquo;ll get in all the same.&nbsp; All for a kiss!&nbsp; But
never mind, we&rsquo;ll do it yet!&rsquo;&nbsp; He spoke in an
affectedly light tone, as if ashamed of his previous resentful
temper; but she could see by the livid back of his neck that he
was brimful of suppressed passion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only a jest, you
know,&rsquo; he went on.&nbsp; &lsquo;How are we going to do it
now?&nbsp; Why, in this way.&nbsp; I go and get a ladder, and
enter at the upper window where my love is.&nbsp; And
there&rsquo;s the ladder lying under that corn-rick in the first
enclosed field.&nbsp; Back in two minutes, dear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He ran off, and was lost to her view.</p>
<h2>XXVIII.&nbsp; ANNE DOES WONDERS</h2>
<p>Anne fearfully surveyed her position.&nbsp; The upper windows
of the cottage were of flimsiest lead-work, and to keep him out
would be hopeless.&nbsp; She felt that not a moment was to be
lost in getting away.&nbsp; Running downstairs she opened the
door, and then it occurred to her terrified understanding that
there would be no chance of escaping him by flight afoot across
such an extensive down, since he might mount his horse and easily
ride after her.&nbsp; The animal still remained tethered at the
corner of the garden; if she could release him and frighten him
away before Festus returned, there would not be quite such odds
against her.&nbsp; She accordingly unhooked the horse by reaching
over the bank, and then, pulling off her muslin neckerchief,
flapped it in his eyes to startle him.&nbsp; But the gallant
steed did not move or flinch; she tried again, and he seemed
rather pleased than otherwise.&nbsp; At this moment she heard a
cry from the cottage, and turning, beheld her adversary
approaching round the corner of the building.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I should tole out the mouse by that
trick!&rsquo; cried Festus exultingly.&nbsp; Instead of going for
a ladder, he had simply hidden himself at the back to tempt her
down.</p>
<p>Poor Anne was now desperate.&nbsp; The bank on which she stood
was level with the horse&rsquo;s back, and the creature seemed
quiet as a lamb.&nbsp; With a determination of which she was
capable in emergencies, she seized the rein, flung herself upon
the sheepskin, and held on by the mane.&nbsp; The amazed charger
lifted his head, sniffed, wrenched his ears hither and thither,
and started off at a frightful speed across the down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, my heart and limbs!&rsquo; said Festus under his
breath, as, thoroughly alarmed, he gazed after her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She on Champion!&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll break her neck, and I
shall be tried for manslaughter, and disgrace will be brought
upon the name of Derriman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Champion continued to go at a stretch-gallop, but he did
nothing worse.&nbsp; Had he plunged or reared, Derriman&rsquo;s
fears might have been verified, and Anne have come with deadly
force to the ground.&nbsp; But the course was good, and in the
horse&rsquo;s speed lay a comparative security.&nbsp; She was
scarcely shaken in her precarious half-horizontal position,
though she was awed to see the grass, loose stones, and other
objects pass her eyes like strokes whenever she opened them,
which was only just for a second at intervals of half a minute;
and to feel how wildly the stirrups swung, and that what struck
her knee was the bucket of the carbine, and that it was a
pistol-holster which hurt her arm.</p>
<p>They quickly cleared the down, and Anne became conscious that
the course of the horse was homeward.&nbsp; As soon as the ground
began to rise towards the outer belt of upland which lay between
her and the coast, Champion, now panting and reeking with
moisture, lessened his speed in sheer weariness, and proceeded at
a rapid jolting trot.&nbsp; Anne felt that she could not hold on
half so well; the gallop had been child&rsquo;s play compared
with this.&nbsp; They were in a lane, ascending to a ridge, and
she made up her mind for a fall.&nbsp; Over the ridge rose an
animated spot, higher and higher; it turned out to be the upper
part of a man, and the man to be a soldier.&nbsp; Such was
Anne&rsquo;s attitude that she only got an occasional glimpse of
him; and, though she feared that he might be a Frenchman, she
feared the horse more than the enemy, as she had feared Festus
more than the horse.&nbsp; Anne had energy enough left to cry,
&lsquo;Stop him; stop him!&rsquo; as the soldier drew near.</p>
<p>He, astonished at the sight of a military horse with a bundle
of drapery across his back, had already placed himself in the
middle of the lane, and he now held out his arms till his figure
assumed the form of a Latin cross planted in the roadway.&nbsp;
Champion drew near, swerved, and stood still almost suddenly, a
check sufficient to send Anne slipping down his flank to the
ground.&nbsp; The timely friend stepped forward and helped her to
her feet, when she saw that he was John Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you hurt?&rsquo; he said hastily, having turned
quite pale at seeing her fall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no; not a bit,&rsquo; said Anne, gathering herself up
with forced briskness, to make light of the misadventure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how did you get in such a place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, he&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo; she exclaimed, instead
of replying, as Champion swept round John Loveday and cantered
off triumphantly in the direction of Oxwell, a performance which
she followed with her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how did you come upon his back, and whose horse is
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;cannot tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John looked steadily at her, saying nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you come here?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is it true that the French have not landed at
all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite true; the alarm was groundless.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
tell you all about it.&nbsp; You look very tired.&nbsp; You had
better sit down a few minutes.&nbsp; Let us sit on this
bank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He helped her to the slope indicated, and continued, still as
if his thoughts were more occupied with the mystery of her recent
situation than with what he was saying: &lsquo;We arrived at
Budmouth Barracks this morning, and are to lie there all the
summer.&nbsp; I could not write to tell father we were
coming.&nbsp; It was not because of any rumour of the French, for
we knew nothing of that till we met the people on the road, and
the colonel said in a moment the news was false.&nbsp; Buonaparte
is not even at Boulogne just now.&nbsp; I was anxious to know how
you had borne the fright, so I hastened to Overcombe at once, as
soon as I could get out of barracks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne, who had not been at all responsive to his discourse, now
swayed heavily against him, and looking quickly down he found
that she had silently fainted.&nbsp; To support her in his arms
was of course the impulse of a moment.&nbsp; There was no water
to be had, and he could think of nothing else but to hold her
tenderly till she came round again.&nbsp; Certainly he desired
nothing more.</p>
<p>Again he asked himself, what did it all mean?</p>
<p>He waited, looking down upon her tired eyelids, and at the row
of lashes lying upon each cheek, whose natural roundness showed
itself in singular perfection now that the customary pink had
given place to a pale luminousness caught from the surrounding
atmosphere.&nbsp; The dumpy ringlets about her forehead and
behind her poll, which were usually as tight as springs, had been
partially uncoiled by the wildness of her ride, and hung in split
locks over her forehead and neck.&nbsp; John, who, during the
long months of his absence, had lived only to meet her again, was
in a state of ecstatic reverence, and bending down he gently
kissed her.</p>
<p>Anne was just becoming conscious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Mr. Derriman, never, never!&rsquo; she murmured,
sweeping her face with her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought he was at the bottom of it,&rsquo; said
John.</p>
<p>Anne opened her eyes, and started back from him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; she said wildly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are ill, my dear Miss Garland,&rsquo; replied John
in trembling anxiety, and taking her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not ill, I am wearied out!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t we walk on?&nbsp; How far are we from
Overcombe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About a mile.&nbsp; But tell me, somebody has been
hurting you&mdash;frightening you.&nbsp; I know who it was; it
was Derriman, and that was his horse.&nbsp; Now do you tell me
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne reflected.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then if I tell you,&rsquo; she
said, &lsquo;will you discuss with me what I had better do, and
not for the present let my mother and your father know?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to alarm them, and I must not let my affairs
interrupt the business connexion between the mill and the hall
that has gone on for so many years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The trumpet-major promised, and Anne told the adventure.&nbsp;
His brow reddened as she went on, and when she had done she said,
&lsquo;Now you are angry.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t do anything dreadful,
will you?&nbsp; Remember that this Festus will most likely
succeed his uncle at Oxwell, in spite of present appearances, and
if Bob succeeds at the mill there should be no enmity between
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t tell Bob.&nbsp;
Leave him to me.&nbsp; Where is Derriman now?&nbsp; On his way
home, I suppose.&nbsp; When I have seen you into the house I will
deal with him&mdash;quite quietly, so that he shall say nothing
about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, appeal to him, do!&nbsp; Perhaps he will be better
then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They walked on together, Loveday seeming to experience much
quiet bliss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came to look for you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;because
of that dear, sweet letter you wrote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I did write you a letter,&rsquo; she admitted,
with misgiving, now beginning to see her mistake.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
was because I was sorry I had blamed you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am almost glad you did blame me,&rsquo; said John
cheerfully, &lsquo;since, if you had not, the letter would not
have come.&nbsp; I have read it fifty times a day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This put Anne into an unhappy mood, and they proceeded without
much further talk till the mill chimneys were visible below
them.&nbsp; John then said that he would leave her to go in by
herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you are going back to get into some danger on my
account?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t get into much danger with such a fellow
as he, can I?&rsquo; said John, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no,&rsquo; she answered, with a sudden
carelessness of tone.&nbsp; It was indispensable that he should
be undeceived, and to begin the process by taking an affectedly
light view of his personal risks was perhaps as good a way to do
it as any.&nbsp; Where friendliness was construed as love, an
assumed indifference was the necessary expression for
friendliness.</p>
<p>So she let him go; and, bidding him hasten back as soon as he
could, went down the hill, while John&rsquo;s feet retraced the
upland.</p>
<p>The trumpet-major spent the whole afternoon and evening in
that long and difficult search for Festus Derriman.&nbsp;
Crossing the down at the end of the second hour he met Molly and
Mrs. Loveday.&nbsp; The gig had been repaired, they had learnt
the groundlessness of the alarm, and they would have been
proceeding happily enough but for their anxiety about Anne.&nbsp;
John told them shortly that she had got a lift home, and
proceeded on his way.</p>
<p>The worthy object of his search had in the meantime been
plodding homeward on foot, sulky at the loss of his charger,
encumbered with his sword, belts, high boots, and uniform, and in
his own discomfiture careless whether Anne Garland&rsquo;s life
had been endangered or not.</p>
<p>At length Derriman reached a place where the road ran between
high banks, one of which he mounted and paced along as a change
from the hard trackway.&nbsp; Ahead of him he saw an old man
sitting down, with eyes fixed on the dust of the road, as if
resting and meditating at one and the same time.&nbsp; Being
pretty sure that he recognized his uncle in that venerable
figure, Festus came forward stealthily, till he was immediately
above the old man&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; The latter was clothed in
faded nankeen breeches, speckled stockings, a drab hat, and a
coat which had once been light blue, but from exposure as a
scarecrow had assumed the complexion and fibre of a dried
pudding-cloth.&nbsp; The farmer was, in fact, returning to the
hall, which he had left in the morning some time later than his
nephew, to seek an asylum in a hollow tree about two miles
off.&nbsp; The tree was so situated as to command a view of the
building, and Uncle Benjy had managed to clamber up inside this
natural fortification high enough to watch his residence through
a hole in the bark, till, gathering from the words of occasional
passers-by that the alarm was at least premature, he had ventured
into daylight again.</p>
<p>He was now engaged in abstractedly tracing a diagram in the
dust with his walking-stick, and muttered words to himself
aloud.&nbsp; Presently he arose and went on his way without
turning round.&nbsp; Festus was curious enough to descend and
look at the marks.&nbsp; They represented an oblong, with two
semi-diagonals, and a little square in the middle.&nbsp; Upon the
diagonals were the figures 20 and 17, and on each side of the
parallelogram stood a letter signifying the point of the
compass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What crazy thing is running in his head now?&rsquo;
said Festus to himself, with supercilious pity, recollecting that
the farmer had been singing those very numbers earlier in the
morning.&nbsp; Being able to make nothing of it, he lengthened
his strides, and treading on tiptoe overtook his relative,
saluting him by scratching his back like a hen.&nbsp; The
startled old farmer danced round like a top, and gasping, said,
as he perceived his nephew, &lsquo;What, Festy! not thrown from
your horse and killed, then, after all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, nunc.&nbsp; What made ye think that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Champion passed me about an hour ago, when I was in
hiding&mdash;poor timid soul of me, for I had nothing to lose by
the French coming&mdash;and he looked awful with the stirrups
dangling and the saddle empty.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a gloomy sight,
Festy, to see a horse cantering without a rider, and I thought
you had been&mdash;feared you had been thrown off and killed as
dead as a nit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless your dear old heart for being so anxious!&nbsp;
And what pretty picture were you drawing just now with your
walking-stick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, that!&nbsp; That is only a way I have of amusing
myself.&nbsp; It showed how the French might have advanced to the
attack, you know.&nbsp; Such trifles fill the head of a weak old
man like me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or the place where something is hid away&mdash;money,
for instance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Festy,&rsquo; said the farmer reproachfully, &lsquo;you
always know I use the old glove in the bedroom cupboard for any
guinea or two I possess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I do,&rsquo; said Festus ironically.</p>
<p>They had now reached a lonely inn about a mile and a half from
the hall, and, the farmer not responding to his nephew&rsquo;s
kind invitation to come in and treat him, Festus entered
alone.&nbsp; He was dusty, draggled, and weary, and he remained
at the tavern long.&nbsp; The trumpet-major, in the meantime,
having searched the roads in vain, heard in the course of the
evening of the yeoman&rsquo;s arrival at this place, and that he
would probably be found there still.&nbsp; He accordingly
approached the door, reaching it just as the dusk of evening
changed to darkness.</p>
<p>There was no light in the passage, but John pushed on at
hazard, inquired for Derriman, and was told that he would be
found in the back parlour alone.&nbsp; When Loveday first entered
the apartment he was unable to see anything, but following the
guidance of a vigorous snoring, he came to the settle, upon which
Festus lay asleep, his position being faintly signified by the
shine of his buttons and other parts of his uniform.&nbsp; John
laid his hand upon the reclining figure and shook him, and by
degrees Derriman stopped his snore and sat up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he said, in the accents of a man
who has been drinking hard.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it you, dear
Anne?&nbsp; Let me kiss you; yes, I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shut your mouth, you pitiful blockhead; I&rsquo;ll
teach you genteeler manners than to persecute a young woman in
that way!&rsquo; and taking Festus by the ear, he gave it a good
pull.&nbsp; Festus broke out with an oath, and struck a vague
blow in the air with his fist; whereupon the trumpet-major dealt
him a box on the right ear, and a similar one on the left to
artistically balance the first.&nbsp; Festus jumped up and used
his fists wildly, but without any definite result.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Want to fight, do ye, eh?&rsquo; said John.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nonsense! you can&rsquo;t fight, you great baby, and never
could.&nbsp; You are only fit to be smacked!&rsquo; and he dealt
Festus a specimen of the same on the cheek with the palm of his
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir, no!&nbsp; O, you are Loveday, the young man
she&rsquo;s going to be married to, I suppose?&nbsp; Dash me, I
didn&rsquo;t want to hurt her, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my name is Loveday; and you&rsquo;ll know where to
find me, since we can&rsquo;t finish this to-night.&nbsp; Pistols
or swords, whichever you like, my boy.&nbsp; Take that, and that,
so that you may not forget to call upon me!&rsquo; and again he
smacked the yeoman&rsquo;s ears and cheeks.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you
know what it is for, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Mr. Loveday, sir&mdash;yes, I mean, I
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it for, then?&nbsp; I shall keep smacking until
you tell me.&nbsp; Gad! if you weren&rsquo;t drunk, I&rsquo;d
half kill you here to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is because I served her badly.&nbsp; Damned if I
care!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do it again, and be hanged to
&rsquo;ee!&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my horse Champion?&nbsp; Tell me
that,&rsquo; and he hit at the trumpet-major.</p>
<p>John parried this attack, and taking him firmly by the collar,
pushed him down into the seat, saying, &lsquo;Here I hold
&rsquo;ee till you beg pardon for your doings to-day.&nbsp; Do
you want any more of it, do you?&rsquo;&nbsp; And he shook the
yeoman to a sort of jelly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do beg pardon&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I say
this, that you shall not take such liberties with old Squire
Derriman&rsquo;s nephew, you dirty miller&rsquo;s son, you
flour-worm, you smut in the corn!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll call you out
to-morrow morning, and have my revenge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you will; that&rsquo;s what I came
for.&rsquo;&nbsp; And pushing him back into the corner of the
settle, Loveday went out of the house, feeling considerable
satisfaction at having got himself into the beginning of as nice
a quarrel about Anne Garland as the most jealous lover could
desire.</p>
<p>But of one feature in this curious adventure he had not the
least notion&mdash;that Festus Derriman, misled by the darkness,
the fumes of his potations, and the constant sight of Anne and
Bob together, never once supposed his assailant to be any other
man than Bob, believing the trumpet-major miles away.</p>
<p>There was a moon during the early part of John&rsquo;s walk
home, but when he had arrived within a mile of Overcombe the sky
clouded over, and rain suddenly began to fall with some
violence.&nbsp; Near him was a wooden granary on tall stone
staddles, and perceiving that the rain was only a thunderstorm
which would soon pass away, he ascended the steps and entered the
doorway, where he stood watching the half-obscured moon through
the streaming rain.&nbsp; Presently, to his surprise, he beheld a
female figure running forward with great rapidity, not towards
the granary for shelter, but towards open ground.&nbsp; What
could she be running for in that direction?&nbsp; The answer came
in the appearance of his brother Bob from that quarter, seated on
the back of his father&rsquo;s heavy horse.&nbsp; As soon as the
woman met him, Bob dismounted and caught her in his arms.&nbsp;
They stood locked together, the rain beating into their
unconscious forms, and the horse looking on.</p>
<p>The trumpet-major fell back inside the granary, and threw
himself on a heap of empty sacks which lay in the corner: he had
recognized the woman to be Anne.&nbsp; Here he reclined in a
stupor till he was aroused by the sound of voices under him, the
voices of Anne and his brother, who, having at last discovered
that they were getting wet, had taken shelter under the granary
floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been home,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mother
and Molly have both got back long ago.&nbsp; We were all anxious
about you, and I came out to look for you.&nbsp; O, Bob, I am so
glad to see you again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>John might have heard every word of the conversation, which
was continued in the same strain for a long time; but he stopped
his ears, and would not.&nbsp; Still they remained, and still was
he determined that they should not see him.&nbsp; With the
conserved hope of more than half a year dashed away in a moment,
he could yet feel that the cruelty of a protest would be even
greater than its inutility.&nbsp; It was absolutely by his own
contrivance that the situation had been shaped.&nbsp; Bob, left
to himself, would long ere this have been the husband of another
woman.</p>
<p>The rain decreased, and the lovers went on.&nbsp; John looked
after them as they strolled, aqua-tinted by the weak moon and
mist.&nbsp; Bob had thrust one of his arms through the rein of
the horse, and the other was round Anne&rsquo;s waist.&nbsp; When
they were lost behind the declivity the trumpet-major came out,
and walked homeward even more slowly than they.&nbsp; As he went
on, his face put off its complexion of despair for one of serene
resolve.&nbsp; For the first time in his dealings with friends he
entered upon a course of counterfeiting, set his features to
conceal his thought, and instructed his tongue to do
likewise.&nbsp; He threw fictitiousness into his very gait, even
now, when there was nobody to see him, and struck at stems of
wild parsley with his regimental switch as he had used to do when
soldiering was new to him, and life in general a charming
experience.</p>
<p>Thus cloaking his sickly thought, he descended to the mill as
the others had done before him, occasionally looking down upon
the wet road to notice how close Anne&rsquo;s little tracks were
to Bob&rsquo;s all the way along, and how precisely a curve in
his course was followed by a curve in hers.&nbsp; But after this
he erected his head and walked so smartly up to the front door
that his spurs rang through the court.</p>
<p>They had all reached home, but before any of them could speak
he cried gaily, &lsquo;Ah, Bob, I have been thinking of
you!&nbsp; By God, how are you, my boy?&nbsp; No French
cut-throats after all, you see.&nbsp; Here we are, well and happy
together again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A good Providence has watched over us,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Loveday cheerfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, in all times and places we
are in God&rsquo;s hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So we be, so we be!&rsquo; said the miller, who still
shone in all the fierceness of uniform.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, now
we&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo;e a drop o&rsquo; drink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s none,&rsquo; said David, coming forward
with a drawn face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; said the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Afore I went to church for a pike to defend my native
country from Boney, I pulled out the spigots of all the barrels,
maister; for, thinks I&mdash;damn him!&mdash;since we can&rsquo;t
drink it ourselves, he shan&rsquo;t have it, nor none of his
men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you shouldn&rsquo;t have done it till you was sure
he&rsquo;d come!&rsquo; said the miller, aghast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chok&rsquo; it all, I was sure!&rsquo; said
David.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d sooner see churches fall than good
drink wasted; but how was I to know better?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well; what with one thing and another this day
will cost me a pretty penny!&rsquo; said Loveday, bustling off to
the cellar, which he found to be several inches deep in stagnant
liquor.&nbsp; &lsquo;John, how can I welcome &rsquo;ee?&rsquo; he
continued hopelessly, on his return to the room.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Only go and see what he&rsquo;s done!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve ladled up a drap wi&rsquo; a spoon,
trumpet-major,&rsquo; said David.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t bad drinking, though it do taste a
little of the floor, that&rsquo;s true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John said that he did not require anything at all; and then
they all sat down to supper, and were very temperately gay with a
drop of mild elder-wine which Mrs. Loveday found in the bottom of
a jar.&nbsp; The trumpet-major, adhering to the part he meant to
play, gave humorous accounts of his adventures since he had last
sat there.&nbsp; He told them that the season was to be a very
lively one&mdash;that the royal family was coming, as usual, and
many other interesting things; so that when he left them to
return to barracks few would have supposed the British army to
contain a lighter-hearted man.</p>
<p>Anne was the only one who doubted the reality of this
behaviour.&nbsp; When she had gone up to her bedroom she stood
for some time looking at the wick of the candle as if it were a
painful object, the expression of her face being shaped by the
conviction that John&rsquo;s afternoon words when he helped her
out of the way of Champion were not in accordance with his words
to-night, and that the dimly-realized kiss during her faintness
was no imaginary one.&nbsp; But in the blissful circumstances of
having Bob at hand again she took optimist views, and persuaded
herself that John would soon begin to see her in the light of a
sister.</p>
<h2>XXIX.&nbsp; A DISSEMBLER</h2>
<p>To cursory view, John Loveday seemed to accomplish this with
amazing ease.&nbsp; Whenever he came from barracks to Overcombe,
which was once or twice a week, he related news of all sorts to
her and Bob with infinite zest, and made the time as happy a one
as had ever been known at the mill, save for himself alone.&nbsp;
He said nothing of Festus, except so far as to inform Anne that
he had expected to see him and been disappointed.&nbsp; On the
evening after the King&rsquo;s arrival at his seaside residence
John appeared again, staying to supper and describing the royal
entry, the many tasteful illuminations and transparencies which
had been exhibited, the quantities of tallow candles burnt for
that purpose, and the swarms of aristocracy who had followed the
King thither.</p>
<p>When supper was over Bob went outside the house to shut the
shutters, which had, as was often the case, been left open some
time after lights were kindled within.&nbsp; John still sat at
the table when his brother approached the window, though the
others had risen and retired.&nbsp; Bob was struck by seeing
through the pane how John&rsquo;s face had changed.&nbsp;
Throughout the supper-time he had been talking to Anne in the gay
tone habitual with him now, which gave greater strangeness to the
gloom of his present appearance.&nbsp; He remained in thought for
a moment, took a letter from his breast-pocket, opened it, and,
with a tender smile at his weakness, kissed the writing before
restoring it to its place.&nbsp; The letter was one that Anne had
written to him at Exonbury.</p>
<p>Bob stood perplexed; and then a suspicion crossed his mind
that John, from brotherly goodness, might be feigning a
satisfaction with recent events which he did not feel.&nbsp; Bob
now made a noise with the shutters, at which the trumpet-major
rose and went out, Bob at once following him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; said the sailor ingenuously,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry that I&rsquo;ve done
wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo; asked his brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In courting our little Anne.&nbsp; Well, you see, John,
she was in the same house with me, and somehow or other I made
myself her beau.&nbsp; But I have been thinking that perhaps you
had the first claim on her, and if so, Jack, I&rsquo;ll make way
for &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care for her much, you
know&mdash;not so very much, and can give her up very well.&nbsp;
It is nothing serious between us at all.&nbsp; Yes, John, you try
to get her; I can look elsewhere.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bob never knew how
much he loved Anne till he found himself making this speech of
renunciation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Bob, you are mistaken!&rsquo; said the trumpet-major,
who was not deceived.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I first saw her I admired
her, and I admire her now, and like her.&nbsp; I like her so well
that I shall be glad to see you marry her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; replied Bob, with hesitation, &lsquo;I
thought I saw you looking very sad, as if you were in love; I saw
you take out a letter, in short.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what it was
disturbed me and made me come to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I see your mistake!&rsquo; said John, laughing
forcedly.</p>
<p>At this minute Mrs. Loveday and the miller, who were taking a
twilight walk in the garden, strolled round near to where the
brothers stood.&nbsp; She talked volubly on events in Budmouth,
as most people did at this time.&nbsp; &lsquo;And they tell me
that the theatre has been painted up afresh,&rsquo; she was
saying, &lsquo;and that the actors have come for the season, with
the most lovely actresses that ever were seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they had passed by John continued, &lsquo;I <i>am</i> in
love, Bob; but&mdash;not with Anne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! who is it then?&rsquo; said the mate hopefully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of the actresses at the theatre,&rsquo; John
replied, with a concoctive look at the vanishing forms of Mr. and
Mrs. Loveday.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is a very lovely woman, you
know.&nbsp; But we won&rsquo;t say anything more about
it&mdash;it dashes a man so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, one of the actresses!&rsquo; said Bob, with open
mouth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you say anything about it!&rsquo;
continued the trumpet-major heartily.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
want it known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no&mdash;I won&rsquo;t, of course.&nbsp; May I not
know her name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not now, Bob.&nbsp; I cannot tell &rsquo;ee,&rsquo;
John answered, and with truth, for Loveday did not know the name
of any actress in the world.</p>
<p>When his brother had gone, Captain Bob hastened off in a state
of great animation to Anne, whom he found on the top of a
neighbouring hillock which the daylight had scarcely as yet
deserted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been a long time coming, sir,&rsquo; said she,
in sprightly tones of reproach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dearest; and you&rsquo;ll be glad to hear
why.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found out the whole
mystery&mdash;yes&mdash;why he&rsquo;s queer, and
everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne looked startled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s up to the gunnel in love!&nbsp; We must try
to help him on in it, or I fear he&rsquo;ll go melancholy-mad
like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We help him?&rsquo; she asked faintly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s lost his heart to one of the play-actresses
at Budmouth, and I think she slights him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I am so glad!&rsquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Glad that his venture don&rsquo;t prosper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no; glad he&rsquo;s so sensible.&nbsp; How long is it
since that alarm of the French?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Six weeks, honey.&nbsp; Why do you ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Men can forget in six weeks, can&rsquo;t they,
Bob?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The impression that John had really kissed her still
remained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, some men might,&rsquo; observed Bob
judicially.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Perhaps
John might.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t forget <i>you</i> in twenty
times as long.&nbsp; Do you know, Anne, I half thought it was you
John cared about; and it was a weight off my heart when he said
he didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he say he didn&rsquo;t?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; He assured me himself that the only person
in the hold of his heart was this lovely play-actress, and nobody
else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How I should like to see her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; So should I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would rather it had been one of our own
neighbours&rsquo; girls, whose birth and breeding we know of; but
still, if that is his taste, I hope it will end well for
him.&nbsp; How very quick he has been!&nbsp; I certainly wish we
could see her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know so much as her name.&nbsp; He is
very close, and wouldn&rsquo;t tell a thing about her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we get him to go to the theatre with us?
and then we could watch him, and easily find out the right
one.&nbsp; Then we would learn if she is a good young woman; and
if she is, could we not ask her here, and so make it smoother for
him?&nbsp; He has been very gay lately; that means budding love:
and sometimes between his gaieties he has had melancholy moments;
that means there&rsquo;s difficulty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob thought her plan a good one, and resolved to put it in
practice on the first available evening.&nbsp; Anne was very
curious as to whether John did really cherish a new passion, the
story having quite surprised her.&nbsp; Possibly it was true; six
weeks had passed since John had shown a single symptom of the old
attachment, and what could not that space of time effect in the
heart of a soldier whose very profession it was to leave girls
behind him?</p>
<p>After this John Loveday did not come to see them for nearly a
month, a neglect which was set down by Bob as an additional proof
that his brother&rsquo;s affections were no longer exclusively
centred in his old home.&nbsp; When at last he did arrive, and
the theatre-going was mentioned to him, the flush of
consciousness which Anne expected to see upon his face was
unaccountably absent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Bob; I should very well like to go to the
theatre,&rsquo; he replied heartily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who is going
besides?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only Anne,&rsquo; Bob told him, and then it seemed to
occur to the trumpet-major that something had been expected of
him.&nbsp; He rose and said privately to Bob with some confusion,
&lsquo;O yes, of course we&rsquo;ll go.&nbsp; As I am connected
with one of the&mdash;in short I can get you in for nothing, you
know.&nbsp; At least let me manage everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes.&nbsp; I wonder you didn&rsquo;t propose to
take us before, Jack, and let us have a good look at
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ought to have.&nbsp; You shall go on a King&rsquo;s
night.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t want me to point her out, Bob; I
have my reasons at present for asking it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll be content with guessing,&rsquo; said his
brother.</p>
<p>When the gallant John was gone, Anne observed, &lsquo;Bob, how
he is changed!&nbsp; I watched him.&nbsp; He showed no feeling,
even when you burst upon him suddenly with the subject nearest
his heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must be because his suit don&rsquo;t fay,&rsquo;
said Captain Bob.</p>
<h2>XXX.&nbsp; AT THE THEATRE ROYAL</h2>
<p>In two or three days a message arrived asking them to attend
at the theatre on the coming evening, with the added request that
they would dress in their gayest clothes, to do justice to the
places taken.&nbsp; Accordingly, in the course of the afternoon
they drove off, Bob having clothed himself in a splendid suit,
recently purchased as an attempt to bring himself nearer to
Anne&rsquo;s style when they appeared in public together.&nbsp;
As finished off by this dashing and really fashionable attire, he
was the perfection of a beau in the dog-days; pantaloons and
boots of the newest make; yards and yards of muslin wound round
his neck, forming a sort of asylum for the lower part of his
face; two fancy waistcoats, and coat-buttons like circular
shaving glasses.&nbsp; The absurd extreme of female fashion,
which was to wear muslin dresses in January, was at this time
equalled by that of the men, who wore clothes enough in August to
melt them.&nbsp; Nobody would have guessed from Bob&rsquo;s
presentation now that he had ever been aloft on a dark night in
the Atlantic, or knew the hundred ingenuities that could be
performed with a rope&rsquo;s end and a marline-spike as well as
his mother tongue.</p>
<p>It was a day of days.&nbsp; Anne wore her celebrated celestial
blue pelisse, her Leghorn hat, and her muslin dress with the
waist under the arms; the latter being decorated with excellent
Honiton lace bought of the woman who travelled from that place to
Overcombe and its neighbourhood with a basketful of her own
manufacture, and a cushion on which she worked by the
wayside.&nbsp; John met the lovers at the inn outside the town,
and after stabling the horse they entered the town together, the
trumpet-major informing them that the watering-place had never
been so full before, that the Court, the Prince of Wales, and
everybody of consequence was there, and that an attic could
scarcely be got for money.&nbsp; The King had gone for a cruise
in his yacht, and they would be in time to see him land.</p>
<p>Then drums and fifes were heard, and in a minute or two they
saw Sergeant Stanner advancing along the street with a firm
countenance, fiery poll, and rigid staring eyes, in front of his
recruiting-party.&nbsp; The sergeant&rsquo;s sword was drawn, and
at intervals of two or three inches along its shining blade were
impaled fluttering one-pound notes, to express the lavish bounty
that was offered.&nbsp; He gave a stern, suppressed nod of
friendship to our people, and passed by.&nbsp; Next they came up
to a waggon, bowered over with leaves and flowers, so that the
men inside could hardly be seen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come to see the King, hip-hip hurrah!&rsquo; cried a
voice within, and turning they saw through the leaves the nose
and face of Cripplestraw.&nbsp; The waggon contained all
Derriman&rsquo;s workpeople.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is your master here?&rsquo; said John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, trumpet-major, sir.&nbsp; But young maister is
coming to fetch us at nine o&rsquo;clock, in case we should be
too blind to drive home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O! where is he now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Anne impatiently, at which the
trumpet-major obediently moved on.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the pier it was six o&rsquo;clock;
the royal yacht was returning; a fact announced by the ships in
the harbour firing a salute.&nbsp; The King came ashore with his
hat in his hand, and returned the salutations of the well-dressed
crowd in his old indiscriminate fashion.&nbsp; While this
cheering and waving of handkerchiefs was going on Anne stood
between the two brothers, who protectingly joined their hands
behind her back, as if she were a delicate piece of statuary that
a push might damage.&nbsp; Soon the King had passed, and
receiving the military salutes of the piquet, joined the Queen
and princesses at Gloucester Lodge, the homely house of red brick
in which he unostentatiously resided.</p>
<p>As there was yet some little time before the theatre would
open, they strayed upon the velvet sands, and listened to the
songs of the sailors, one of whom extemporized for the
occasion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Portland Road the King aboard, the King
aboard!<br />
Portland Road the King aboard,<br />
We weighed and sailed from Portland Road!&rsquo; <a
name="citation272"></a><a href="#footnote272"
class="citation">[272]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When they had looked on awhile at the combats at single-stick
which were in progress hard by, and seen the sum of five guineas
handed over to the modest gentleman who had broken most heads,
they returned to Gloucester Lodge, whence the King and other
members of his family now reappeared, and drove, at a slow trot,
round to the theatre in carriages drawn by the Hanoverian white
horses that were so well known in the town at this date.</p>
<p>When Anne and Bob entered the theatre they found that John had
taken excellent places, and concluded that he had got them for
nothing through the influence of the lady of his choice.&nbsp; As
a matter of fact he had paid full prices for those two seats,
like any other outsider, and even then had a difficulty in
getting them, it being a King&rsquo;s night.&nbsp; When they were
settled he himself retired to an obscure part of the pit, from
which the stage was scarcely visible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can see beautifully,&rsquo; said Bob, in an
aristocratic voice, as he took a delicate pinch of snuff, and
drew out the magnificent pocket-handkerchief brought home from
the East for such occasions.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I am afraid poor
John can&rsquo;t see at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we can see him,&rsquo; replied Anne, &lsquo;and
notice by his face which of them it is he is so charmed
with.&nbsp; The light of that corner candle falls right upon his
cheek.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time the King had appeared in his place, which was
overhung by a canopy of crimson satin fringed with gold.&nbsp;
About twenty places were occupied by the royal family and suite;
and beyond them was a crowd of powdered and glittering personages
of fashion, completely filling the centre of the little building;
though the King so frequently patronized the local stage during
these years that the crush was not inconvenient.</p>
<p>The curtain rose and the play began.&nbsp; To-night it was one
of Colman&rsquo;s, who at this time enjoyed great popularity, and
Mr. Bannister supported the leading character.&nbsp; Anne, with
her hand privately clasped in Bob&rsquo;s, and looking as if she
did not know it, partly watched the piece and partly the face of
the impressionable John who had so soon transferred his
affections elsewhere.&nbsp; She had not long to wait.&nbsp; When
a certain one of the subordinate ladies of the comedy entered on
the stage the trumpet-major in his corner not only looked
conscious, but started and gazed with parted lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This must be the one,&rsquo; whispered Anne
quickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;See, he is agitated!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned to Bob, but at the same moment his hand
convulsively closed upon hers as he, too, strangely fixed his
eyes upon the newly-entered lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne looked from one to the other without regarding the stage
at all.&nbsp; Her answer came in the voice of the actress who now
spoke for the first time.&nbsp; The accents were those of Miss
Matilda Johnson.</p>
<p>One thought rushed into both their minds on the instant, and
Bob was the first to utter it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;is she the woman of his choice after
all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If so, it is a dreadful thing!&rsquo; murmured
Anne.</p>
<p>But, as may be imagined, the unfortunate John was as much
surprised by this rencounter as the other two.&nbsp; Until this
moment he had been in utter ignorance of the theatrical company
and all that pertained to it.&nbsp; Moreover, much as he knew of
Miss Johnson, he was not aware that she had ever been trained in
her youth as an actress, and that after lapsing into straits and
difficulties for a couple of years she had been so fortunate as
to again procure an engagement here.</p>
<p>The trumpet-major, though not prominently seated, had been
seen by Matilda already, who had observed still more plainly her
old betrothed and Anne in the other part of the house.&nbsp; John
was not concerned on his own account at being face to face with
her, but at the extraordinary suspicion that this conjuncture
must revive in the minds of his best beloved friends.&nbsp; After
some moments of pained reflection he tapped his knee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gad, I won&rsquo;t explain; it shall go as it
is!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let them think her mine.&nbsp;
Better that than the truth, after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Had personal prominence in the scene been at this moment
proportioned to intentness of feeling, the whole audience, regal
and otherwise, would have faded into an indistinct mist of
background, leaving as the sole emergent and telling figures Bob
and Anne at one point, the trumpet-major on the left hand, and
Matilda at the opposite corner of the stage.&nbsp; But
fortunately the deadlock of awkward suspense into which all four
had fallen was terminated by an accident.&nbsp; A messenger
entered the King&rsquo;s box with despatches.&nbsp; There was an
instant pause in the performance.&nbsp; The despatch-box being
opened the King read for a few moments with great interest, the
eyes of the whole house, including those of Anne Garland, being
anxiously fixed upon his face; for terrible events fell as
unexpectedly as thunderbolts at this critical time of our
history.&nbsp; The King at length beckoned to Lord ---, who was
immediately behind him, the play was again stopped, and the
contents of the despatch were publicly communicated to the
audience.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Calder, cruising off Finisterre, had come in sight
of Villeneuve, and made the signal for action, which, though
checked by the weather, had resulted in the capture of two
Spanish line-of-battle ships, and the retreat of Villeneuve into
Ferrol.</p>
<p>The news was received with truly national feeling, if noise
might be taken as an index of patriotism.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rule
Britannia&rsquo; was called for and sung by the whole
house.&nbsp; But the importance of the event was far from being
recognized at this time; and Bob Loveday, as he sat there and
heard it, had very little conception how it would bear upon his
destiny.</p>
<p>This parenthetic excitement diverted for a few minutes the
eyes of Bob and Anne from the trumpet-major; and when the play
proceeded, and they looked back to his corner, he was gone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s just slipped round to talk to her behind the
scenes,&rsquo; said Bob knowingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall we go too,
and tease him for a sly dog?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I would rather not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we go home, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not unless her presence is too much for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;not at all.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll stay here.&nbsp;
Ah, there she is again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They sat on, and listened to Matilda&rsquo;s speeches which
she delivered with such delightful coolness that they soon began
to considerably interest one of the party.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what a nerve the young woman has!&rsquo; he said
at last in tones of admiration, and gazing at Miss Johnson with
all his might.&nbsp; &lsquo;After all, Jack&rsquo;s taste is not
so bad.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s really deuced clever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bob, I&rsquo;ll go home if you wish to,&rsquo; said
Anne quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;let us see how she fleets herself off that
bit of a scrape she&rsquo;s playing at now.&nbsp; Well, what a
hand she is at it, to be sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne said no more, but waited on, supremely uncomfortable, and
almost tearful.&nbsp; She began to feel that she did not like
life particularly well; it was too complicated: she saw nothing
of the scene, and only longed to get away, and to get Bob away
with her.&nbsp; At last the curtain fell on the final act, and
then began the farce of &lsquo;No Song no Supper.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Matilda did not appear in this piece, and Anne again inquired if
they should go home.&nbsp; This time Bob agreed, and taking her
under his care with redoubled affection, to make up for the
species of coma which had seized upon his heart for a time, he
quietly accompanied her out of the house.</p>
<p>When they emerged upon the esplanade, the August moon was
shining across the sea from the direction of St. Aldhelm&rsquo;s
Head.&nbsp; Bob unconsciously loitered, and turned towards the
pier.&nbsp; Reaching the end of the promenade they surveyed the
quivering waters in silence for some time, until a long dark line
shot from behind the promontory of the Nothe, and swept forward
into the harbour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What boat is that?&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems to be some frigate lying in the Roads,&rsquo;
said Bob carelessly, as he brought Anne round with a gentle
pressure of his arm and bent his steps towards the homeward end
of the town.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Miss Johnson, having finished her duties for that
evening, rapidly changed her dress, and went out likewise.&nbsp;
The prominent position which Anne and Captain Bob had occupied
side by side in the theatre, left her no alternative but to
suppose that the situation was arranged by Bob as a species of
defiance to herself; and her heart, such as it was, became
proportionately embittered against him.&nbsp; In spite of the
rise in her fortunes, Miss Johnson still remembered&mdash;and
always would remember&mdash;her humiliating departure from
Overcombe; and it had been to her even a more grievous thing that
Bob had acquiesced in his brother&rsquo;s ruling than that John
had determined it.&nbsp; At the time of setting out she was
sustained by a firm faith that Bob would follow her, and nullify
his brother&rsquo;s scheme; but though she waited Bob never
came.</p>
<p>She passed along by the houses facing the sea, and scanned the
shore, the footway, and the open road close to her, which,
illuminated by the slanting moon to a great brightness, sparkled
with minute facets of crystallized salts from the water sprinkled
there during the day.&nbsp; The promenaders at the further edge
appeared in dark profiles; and beyond them was the grey sea,
parted into two masses by the tapering braid of moonlight across
the waves.</p>
<p>Two forms crossed this line at a startling nearness to her;
she marked them at once as Anne and Bob Loveday.&nbsp; They were
walking slowly, and in the earnestness of their discourse were
oblivious of the presence of any human beings save
themselves.&nbsp; Matilda stood motionless till they had
passed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How I love them!&rsquo; she said, treading the initial
step of her walk onwards with a vehemence that walking did not
demand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So do I&mdash;especially one,&rsquo; said a voice at
her elbow; and a man wheeled round her, and looked in her face,
which had been fully exposed to the moon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&mdash;who are you?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp; We walked
some way together towards Overcombe earlier in the
summer.&rsquo;&nbsp; Matilda looked more closely, and perceived
that the speaker was Derriman, in plain clothes.&nbsp; He
continued, &lsquo;You are one of the ladies of the theatre, I
know.&nbsp; May I ask why you said in such a queer way that you
loved that couple?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a queer way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, as if you hated them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind your knowing that I have good reason
to hate them.&nbsp; You do too, it seems?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That man,&rsquo; said Festus savagely, &lsquo;came to
me one night about that very woman; insulted me before I could
put myself on my guard, and ran away before I could come up with
him and avenge myself.&nbsp; The woman tricks me at every
turn!&nbsp; I want to part &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
splendid opportunity.&nbsp; Do you see that soldier walking
along?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a marine; he looks into the gallery of
the theatre every night: and he&rsquo;s in connexion with the
press-gang that came ashore just now from the frigate lying in
Portland Roads.&nbsp; They are often here for men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Our boatmen dread &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we have only to tell him that Loveday is a seaman
to be clear of him this very night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Done!&rsquo; said Festus.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take my arm and
come this way.&rsquo;&nbsp; They walked across to the
footway.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fine night, sergeant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Looking for hands, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not to be known, sir.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t begin
till half past ten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a pity you don&rsquo;t begin now.&nbsp; I could
show &rsquo;ee excellent game.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, that little nest of fellows at the &ldquo;Old
Rooms&rdquo; in Cove Row?&nbsp; I have just heard of
&rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;come here.&rsquo;&nbsp; Festus, with Miss
Johnson on his arm, led the sergeant quickly along the parade,
and by the time they reached the Narrows the lovers, who walked
but slowly, were visible in front of them.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s your man,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That buck in pantaloons and half-boots&mdash;a looking
like a squire?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twelve months ago he was mate of the brig Pewit; but
his father has made money, and keeps him at home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith, now you tell of it, there&rsquo;s a hint of sea
legs about him.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the young beau&rsquo;s
name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell!&rsquo; whispered Matilda, impulsively
clutching Festus&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>But Festus had already said, &lsquo;Robert Loveday, son of the
miller at Overcombe.&nbsp; You may find several likely fellows in
that neighbourhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The marine said that he would bear it in mind, and they left
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you had not told,&rsquo; said Matilda
tearfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s the worst!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dash my eyes now; listen to that!&nbsp; Why, you
chicken-hearted old stager, you was as well agreed as I.&nbsp;
Come now; hasn&rsquo;t he used you badly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Matilda&rsquo;s acrimony returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was down on
my luck, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have had the chance!&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, let things be.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>XXXI.&nbsp; MIDNIGHT VISITORS</h2>
<p>Miss Garland and Loveday walked leisurely to the inn and
called for horse-and-gig.&nbsp; While the hostler was bringing it
round, the landlord, who knew Bob and his family well, spoke to
him quietly in the passage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this then because you want to throw dust in the eyes
of the Black Diamond chaps?&rsquo; (with an admiring glance at
Bob&rsquo;s costume).</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Black Diamond?&rsquo; said Bob; and Anne turned
pale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She hove in sight just after dark, and at nine
o&rsquo;clock a boat having more than a dozen marines on board,
with cloaks on, rowed into harbour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob reflected.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then there&rsquo;ll be a press
to-night; depend upon it,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They won&rsquo;t know you, will they, Bob?&rsquo; said
Anne anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They certainly won&rsquo;t know him for a seaman
now,&rsquo; remarked the landlord, laughing, and again surveying
Bob up and down.&nbsp; &lsquo;But if I was you two, I should
drive home-along straight and quiet; and be very busy in the mill
all to-morrow, Mr. Loveday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They drove away; and when they had got onward out of the town,
Anne strained her eyes wistfully towards Portland.&nbsp; Its dark
contour, lying like a whale on the sea, was just perceptible in
the gloom as the background to half-a-dozen ships&rsquo; lights
nearer at hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They can&rsquo;t make you go, now you are a gentleman
tradesman, can they?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they want me they can have me, dearest.&nbsp; I have
often said I ought to volunteer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And not care about me at all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is just that that keeps me at home.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t leave you if I can help it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot make such a vast difference to the country
whether one man goes or stays!&nbsp; But if you want to go you
had better, and not mind us at all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob put a period to her speech by a mark of affection to which
history affords many parallels in every age.&nbsp; She said no
more about the Black Diamond; but whenever they ascended a hill
she turned her head to look at the lights in Portland Roads, and
the grey expanse of intervening sea.</p>
<p>Though Captain Bob had stated that he did not wish to
volunteer, and would not leave her if he could help it, the
remark required some qualification.&nbsp; That Anne was charming
and loving enough to chain him anywhere was true; but he had
begun to find the mill-work terribly irksome at times.&nbsp;
Often during the last month, when standing among the rumbling
cogs in his new miller&rsquo;s suit, which ill became him, he had
yawned, thought wistfully of the old pea-jacket, and the waters
of the deep blue sea.&nbsp; His dread of displeasing his father
by showing anything of this change of sentiment was great; yet he
might have braved it but for knowing that his marriage with Anne,
which he hoped might take place the next year, was dependent
entirely upon his adherence to the mill business.&nbsp; Even were
his father indifferent, Mrs. Loveday would never intrust her only
daughter to the hands of a husband who would be away from home
five-sixths of his time.</p>
<p>But though, apart from Anne, he was not averse to seafaring in
itself, to be smuggled thither by the machinery of a press-gang
was intolerable; and the process of seizing, stunning, pinioning,
and carrying off unwilling hands was one which Bob as a man had
always determined to hold out against to the utmost of his
power.&nbsp; Hence, as they went towards home, he frequently
listened for sounds behind him, but hearing none he assured his
sweetheart that they were safe for that night at least.&nbsp; The
mill was still going when they arrived, though old Mr. Loveday
was not to be seen; he had retired as soon as he heard the
horse&rsquo;s hoofs in the lane, leaving Bob to watch the
grinding till three o&rsquo;clock; when the elder would rise, and
Bob withdraw to bed&mdash;a frequent arrangement between them
since Bob had taken the place of grinder.</p>
<p>Having reached the privacy of her own room, Anne threw open
the window, for she had not the slightest intention of going to
bed just yet.&nbsp; The tale of the Black Diamond had disturbed
her by a slow, insidious process that was worse than sudden
fright.&nbsp; Her window looked into the court before the house,
now wrapped in the shadow of the trees and the hill; and she
leaned upon its sill listening intently.&nbsp; She could have
heard any strange sound distinctly enough in one direction; but
in the other all low noises were absorbed in the patter of the
mill, and the rush of water down the race.</p>
<p>However, what she heard came from the hitherto silent side,
and was intelligible in a moment as being the footsteps of
men.&nbsp; She tried to think they were some late stragglers from
Budmouth.&nbsp; Alas! no; the tramp was too regular for that of
villagers.&nbsp; She hastily turned, extinguished the candle, and
listened again.&nbsp; As they were on the main road there was,
after all, every probability that the party would pass the bridge
which gave access to the mill court without turning in upon it,
or even noticing that such an entrance existed.&nbsp; In this
again she was disappointed: they crossed into the front without a
pause.&nbsp; The pulsations of her heart became a turmoil now,
for why should these men, if they were the press-gang, and
strangers to the locality, have supposed that a sailor was to be
found here, the younger of the two millers Loveday being never
seen now in any garb which could suggest that he was other than a
miller pure, like his father?&nbsp; One of the men spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not sure that we are in the right place,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a mill, anyhow,&rsquo; said another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s lots about here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then come this way a moment with your light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two of the group went towards the cart-house on the opposite
side of the yard, and when they reached it a dark lantern was
opened, the rays being directed upon the front of the
miller&rsquo;s waggon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Loveday and Son, Overcombe Mill,&rdquo;&rsquo;
continued the man, reading from the waggon.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; you see, is lately painted in.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s our man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He moved to turn off the light, but before he had done so it
flashed over the forms of the speakers, and revealed a sergeant,
a naval officer, and a file of marines.</p>
<p>Anne waited to see no more.&nbsp; When Bob stayed up to grind,
as he was doing to-night, he often sat in his room instead of
remaining all the time in the mill; and this room was an isolated
chamber over the bakehouse, which could not be reached without
going downstairs and ascending the step-ladder that served for
his staircase.&nbsp; Anne descended in the dark, clambered up the
ladder, and saw that light strayed through the chink below the
door.&nbsp; His window faced towards the garden, and hence the
light could not as yet have been seen by the press-gang.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bob, dear Bob!&rsquo; she said, through the
keyhole.&nbsp; &lsquo;Put out your light, and run out of the
back-door!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said Bob, leisurely knocking the ashes from
the pipe he had been smoking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The press-gang!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have come?&nbsp; By God! who can have blown upon
me?&nbsp; All right, dearest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m game.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne, scarcely knowing what she did, descended the ladder and
ran to the back-door, hastily unbolting it to save Bob&rsquo;s
time, and gently opening it in readiness for him.&nbsp; She had
no sooner done this than she felt hands laid upon her shoulder
from without, and a voice exclaiming, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s how we
doos it&mdash;quite an obleeging young man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though the hands held her rather roughly, Anne did not mind
for herself, and turning she cried desperately, in tones intended
to reach Bob&rsquo;s ears: &lsquo;They are at the back-door; try
the front!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But inexperienced Miss Garland little knew the shrewd habits
of the gentlemen she had to deal with, who, well used to this
sort of pastime, had already posted themselves at every outlet
from the premises.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bring the lantern,&rsquo; shouted the fellow who held
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why&mdash;&rsquo;tis a girl!&nbsp; I half
thought so&mdash;Here is a way in,&rsquo; he continued to his
comrades, hastening to the foot of the ladder which led to
Bob&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What d&rsquo;ye want?&rsquo; said Bob, quietly opening
the door, and showing himself still radiant in the full dress
that he had worn with such effect at the Theatre Royal, which he
had been about to change for his mill suit when Anne gave the
alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This gentleman can&rsquo;t be the right one,&rsquo;
observed a marine, rather impressed by Bob&rsquo;s
appearance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; that&rsquo;s the man,&rsquo; said the
sergeant.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now take it quietly, my young
cock-o&rsquo;-wax.&nbsp; You look as if you meant to, and
&rsquo;tis wise of ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going to take me?&rsquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only aboard the Black Diamond.&nbsp; If you choose to
take the bounty and come voluntarily, you&rsquo;ll be allowed to
go ashore whenever your ship&rsquo;s in port.&nbsp; If you
don&rsquo;t, and we&rsquo;ve got to pinion ye, you will not have
your liberty at all.&nbsp; As you must come, willy-nilly,
you&rsquo;ll do the first if you&rsquo;ve any brains
whatever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s temper began to rise.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
talk so large, about your pinioning, my man.&nbsp; When
I&rsquo;ve settled&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now or never, young blow-hard,&rsquo; interrupted his
informant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, what jabber is this going on?&rsquo; said the
lieutenant, stepping forward.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bring your
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of the marines set foot on the ladder, but at the same
moment a shoe from Bob&rsquo;s hand hit the lantern with
well-aimed directness, knocking it clean out of the grasp of the
man who held it.&nbsp; In spite of the darkness they began to
scramble up the ladder.&nbsp; Bob thereupon shut the door, which
being but of slight construction, was as he knew only a momentary
defence.&nbsp; But it gained him time enough to open the window,
gather up his legs upon the sill, and spring across into the
apple-tree growing without.&nbsp; He alighted without much hurt
beyond a few scratches from the boughs, a shower of falling
apples testifying to the force of his leap.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here he is!&rsquo; shouted several below who had seen
Bob&rsquo;s figure flying like a raven&rsquo;s across the
sky.</p>
<p>There was stillness for a moment in the tree.&nbsp; Then the
fugitive made haste to climb out upon a low-hanging branch
towards the garden, at which the men beneath all rushed in that
direction to catch him as he dropped, saying, &lsquo;You may as
well come down, old boy.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a spry jump, and we
give ye credit for &lsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The latter movement of Loveday had been a mere feint.&nbsp;
Partly hidden by the leaves he glided back to the other part of
the tree, from whence it was easy to jump upon a thatch-covered
out-house.&nbsp; This intention they did not appear to suspect,
which gave him the opportunity of sliding down the slope and
entering the back door of the mill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s here, he&rsquo;s here!&rsquo; the men
exclaimed, running back from the tree.</p>
<p>By this time they had obtained another light, and pursued him
closely along the back quarters of the mill.&nbsp; Bob had
entered the lower room, seized hold of the chain by which the
flour-sacks were hoisted from story to story by connexion with
the mill-wheel, and pulled the rope that hung alongside for the
purpose of throwing it into gear.&nbsp; The foremost pursuers
arrived just in time to see Captain Bob&rsquo;s legs and
shoe-buckles vanishing through the trap-door in the joists
overhead, his person having been whirled up by the machinery like
any bag of flour, and the trap falling to behind him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone up by the hoist!&rsquo; said the
sergeant, running up the ladder in the corner to the next floor,
and elevating the light just in time to see Bob&rsquo;s suspended
figure ascending in the same way through the same sort of trap
into the second floor.&nbsp; The second trap also fell together
behind him, and he was lost to view as before.</p>
<p>It was more difficult to follow now; there was only a flimsy
little ladder, and the men ascended cautiously.&nbsp; When they
stepped out upon the loft it was empty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He must ha&rsquo; let go here,&rsquo; said one of the
marines, who knew more about mills than the others.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If he had held fast a moment longer, he would have been
dashed against that beam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They looked up.&nbsp; The hook by which Bob had held on had
ascended to the roof, and was winding round the cylinder.&nbsp;
Nothing was visible elsewhere but boarded divisions like the
stalls of a stable, on each side of the stage they stood upon,
these compartments being more or less heaped up with wheat and
barley in the grain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s buried himself in the
corn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The whole crew jumped into the corn-bins, and stirred about
their yellow contents; but neither arm, leg, nor coat-tail was
uncovered.&nbsp; They removed sacks, peeped among the rafters of
the roof, but to no purpose.&nbsp; The lieutenant began to fume
at the loss of time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What cursed fools to let the man go!&nbsp; Why, look
here, what&rsquo;s this?&rsquo;&nbsp; He had opened the door by
which sacks were taken in from waggons without, and dangling from
the cat-head projecting above it was the rope used in lifting
them.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the way he went down,&rsquo; the
officer continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;The man&rsquo;s gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Amidst mumblings and curses the gang descended the pair of
ladders and came into the open air; but Captain Bob was nowhere
to be seen.&nbsp; When they reached the front door of the house
the miller was standing on the threshold, half dressed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your son is a clever fellow, miller,&rsquo; said the
lieutenant; &lsquo;but it would have been much better for him if
he had come quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a matter of opinion,&rsquo; said
Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no doubt that he&rsquo;s in the
house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He may be; and he may not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know where he is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not; and if I did I shouldn&rsquo;t
tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Naturally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard steps beating up the road, sir,&rsquo; said the
sergeant.</p>
<p>They turned from the door, and leaving four of the marines to
keep watch round the house, the remainder of the party marched
into the lane as far as where the other road branched off.&nbsp;
While they were pausing to decide which course to take, one of
the soldiers held up the light.&nbsp; A black object was
discernible upon the ground before them, and they found it to be
a hat&mdash;the hat of Bob Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are on the track,&rsquo; cried the sergeant,
deciding for this direction.</p>
<p>They tore on rapidly, and the footsteps previously heard
became audible again, increasing in clearness, which told that
they gained upon the fugitive, who in another five minutes
stopped and turned.&nbsp; The rays of the candle fell upon
Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; she said, showing her
frightened face.</p>
<p>They made no reply, but wheeled round and left her.&nbsp; She
sank down on the bank to rest, having done all she could.&nbsp;
It was she who had taken down Bob&rsquo;s hat from a nail, and
dropped it at the turning with the view of misleading them till
he should have got clear off.</p>
<h2>XXXII.&nbsp; DELIVERANCE</h2>
<p>But Anne Garland was too anxious to remain long away from the
centre of operations.&nbsp; When she got back she found that the
press-gang were standing in the court discussing their next
move.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Waste no more time here,&rsquo; the lieutenant
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two more villages to visit to-night, and the
nearest three miles off.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nobody else in this
place, and we can&rsquo;t come back again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they were moving away, one of the private marines, who
had kept his eye on Anne, and noticed her distress, contrived to
say in a whisper as he passed her, &lsquo;We are coming back
again as soon as it begins to get light; that&rsquo;s only said
to deceive &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Keep your young man out of the
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went as they had come; and the little household then met
together, Mrs. Loveday having by this time dressed herself and
come down.&nbsp; A long and anxious discussion followed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somebody must have told upon the chap,&rsquo; Loveday
remarked.&nbsp; &lsquo;How should they have found him out else,
now he&rsquo;s been home from sea this twelvemonth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne then mentioned what the friendly marine had told her; and
fearing lest Bob was in the house, and would be discovered there
when daylight came, they searched and called for him
everywhere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What clothes has he got on?&rsquo; said the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His lovely new suit,&rsquo; said his wife.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I warrant it is quite spoiled!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s got no hat,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Loveday, &lsquo;you two go and lie
down now and I&rsquo;ll bide up; and as soon as he comes in,
which he&rsquo;ll do most likely in the course of the night,
I&rsquo;ll let him know that they are coming again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne and Mrs. Loveday went to their bedrooms, and the miller
entered the mill as if he were simply staying up to grind.&nbsp;
But he continually left the flour-shoot to go outside and walk
round; each time he could see no living being near the
spot.&nbsp; Anne meanwhile had lain down dressed upon her bed,
the window still open, her ears intent upon the sound of
footsteps and dreading the reappearance of daylight and the
gang&rsquo;s return.&nbsp; Three or four times during the night
she descended to the mill to inquire of her stepfather if Bob had
shown himself; but the answer was always in the negative.</p>
<p>At length the curtains of her bed began to reveal their
pattern, the brass handles of the drawers gleamed forth, and day
dawned.&nbsp; While the light was yet no more than a suffusion of
pallor, she arose, put on her hat, and determined to explore the
surrounding premises before the men arrived.&nbsp; Emerging into
the raw loneliness of the daybreak, she went upon the bridge and
looked up and down the road.&nbsp; It was as she had left it,
empty, and the solitude was rendered yet more insistent by the
silence of the mill-wheel, which was now stopped, the miller
having given up expecting Bob and retired to bed about three
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The footprints of the marines still remained
in the dust on the bridge, all the heel-marks towards the house,
showing that the party had not as yet returned.</p>
<p>While she lingered she heard a slight noise in the other
direction, and, turning, saw a woman approaching.&nbsp; The woman
came up quickly, and, to her amazement, Anne recognized
Matilda.&nbsp; Her walk was convulsive, face pale, almost
haggard, and the cold light of the morning invested it with all
the ghostliness of death.&nbsp; She had plainly walked all the
way from Budmouth, for her shoes were covered with dust.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has the press-gang been here?&rsquo; she gasped.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If not they are coming!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And got him&mdash;I am too late!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; they are coming back again.&nbsp; Why did
you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came to try to save him.&nbsp; Can we save him?&nbsp;
Where is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne looked the woman in the face, and it was impossible to
doubt that she was in earnest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am trying to find him before they come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you not let me help you?&rsquo; cried the
repentant Matilda.</p>
<p>Without either objecting or assenting Anne turned and led the
way to the back part of the homestead.</p>
<p>Matilda, too, had suffered that night.&nbsp; From the moment
of parting with Festus Derriman a sentiment of revulsion from the
act to which she had been a party set in and increased, till at
length it reached an intensity of remorse which she could not
passively bear.&nbsp; She had risen before day and hastened
thitherward to know the worst, and if possible hinder
consequences that she had been the first to set in train.</p>
<p>After going hither and thither in the adjoining field, Anne
entered the garden.&nbsp; The walks were bathed in grey dew, and
as she passed observantly along them it appeared as if they had
been brushed by some foot at a much earlier hour.&nbsp; At the
end of the garden, bushes of broom, laurel, and yew formed a
constantly encroaching shrubbery, that had come there almost by
chance, and was never trimmed.&nbsp; Behind these bushes was a
garden-seat, and upon it lay Bob sound asleep.</p>
<p>The ends of his hair were clotted with damp, and there was a
foggy film upon the mirror-like buttons of his coat, and upon the
buckles of his shoes.&nbsp; His bunch of new gold seals was
dimmed by the same insidious dampness; his shirt-frill and muslin
neckcloth were limp as seaweed.&nbsp; It was plain that he had
been there a long time.&nbsp; Anne shook him, but he did not
awake, his breathing being slow and stertorous.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bob, wake; &rsquo;tis your own Anne!&rsquo; she said,
with innocent earnestness; and then, fearfully turning her head,
she saw that Matilda was close behind her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t mind me,&rsquo; said Matilda
bitterly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am on your side now.&nbsp; Shake him
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne shook him again, but he slept on.&nbsp; Then she noticed
that his forehead bore the mark of a heavy wound.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fancy I hear something!&rsquo; said her companion,
starting forward and endeavouring to wake Bob herself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is stunned, or drugged!&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;there
is no rousing him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne raised her head and listened.&nbsp; From the direction of
the eastern road came the sound of a steady tramp.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They are coming back!&rsquo; she said, clasping her
hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;They will take him, ill as he is!&nbsp; He
won&rsquo;t open his eyes&mdash;no, it is no use!&nbsp; O, what
shall we do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Matilda did not reply, but running to the end of the seat on
which Bob lay, tried its weight in her arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not too heavy,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
take that end, and I&rsquo;ll take this.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll carry
him away to some place of hiding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne instantly seized the other end, and they proceeded with
their burden at a slow pace to the lower garden-gate, which they
reached as the tread of the press-gang resounded over the bridge
that gave access to the mill court, now hidden from view by the
hedge and the trees of the garden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will go down inside this field,&rsquo; said Anne
faintly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; said the other; &lsquo;they will see our
foot-tracks in the dew.&nbsp; We must go into the
road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the very road they will come down when they leave
the mill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot be helped; it is neck or nothing with us
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they emerged upon the road, and staggered along without
speaking, occasionally resting for a moment to ease their arms;
then shaking him to arouse him, and finding it useless, seizing
the seat again.&nbsp; When they had gone about two hundred yards
Matilda betrayed signs of exhaustion, and she asked, &lsquo;Is
there no shelter near?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we get to that little field of corn,&rsquo; said
Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is so very far.&nbsp; Surely there is some place
near?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to a few scrubby bushes overhanging a little
stream, which passed under the road near this point.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are not thick enough,&rsquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us take him under the bridge,&rsquo; said
Matilda.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can go no further.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Entering the opening by which cattle descended to drink, they
waded into the weedy water, which here rose a few inches above
their ankles.&nbsp; To ascend the stream, stoop under the arch,
and reach the centre of the roadway, was the work of a few
minutes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they look under the arch we are lost,&rsquo;
murmured Anne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no parapet to the bridge, and they may pass
over without heeding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They waited, their heads almost in contact with the reeking
arch, and their feet encircled by the stream, which was at its
summer lowness now.&nbsp; For some minutes they could hear
nothing but the babble of the water over their ankles, and round
the legs of the seat on which Bob slumbered, the sounds being
reflected in a musical tinkle from the hollow sides of the
arch.&nbsp; Anne&rsquo;s anxiety now was lest he should not
continue sleeping till the search was over, but start up with his
habitual imprudence, and scorning such means of safety, rush out
into their arms.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour dragged by, and then indications reached
their ears that the re-examination of the mill had begun and
ended.&nbsp; The well-known tramp drew nearer, and reverberated
through the ground over their heads, where its volume signified
to the listeners that the party had been largely augmented by
pressed men since the night preceding.&nbsp; The gang passed the
arch, and the noise regularly diminished, as if no man among them
had thought of looking aside for a moment.</p>
<p>Matilda broke the silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wonder if they have
left a watch behind?&rsquo; she said doubtfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will go and see,&rsquo; said Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wait
till I return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I can do no more.&nbsp; When you come back I shall
be gone.&nbsp; I ask one thing of you.&nbsp; If all goes well
with you and him, and he marries you&mdash;don&rsquo;t be
alarmed; my plans lie elsewhere&mdash;when you are his wife tell
him who helped to carry him away.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t mention
my name to the rest of your family, either now or at any
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne regarded the speaker for a moment, and promised; after
which she waded out from the archway.</p>
<p>Matilda stood looking at Bob for a moment, as if preparing to
go, till moved by some impulse she bent and lightly kissed him
once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you!&rsquo; cried Anne reproachfully.&nbsp;
When leaving the mouth of the arch she had bent back and seen the
act.</p>
<p>Matilda flushed.&nbsp; &lsquo;You jealous baby!&rsquo; she
said scornfully.</p>
<p>Anne hesitated for a moment, then went out from the water, and
hastened towards the mill.</p>
<p>She entered by the garden, and, seeing no one, advanced and
peeped in at the window.&nbsp; Her mother and Mr. Loveday were
sitting within as usual.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are they all gone?&rsquo; said Anne softly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; They did not trouble us much, beyond going
into every room, and searching about the garden, where they saw
steps.&nbsp; They have been lucky to-night; they have caught
fifteen or twenty men at places further on; so the loss of Bob
was no hurt to their feelings.&nbsp; I wonder where in the world
the poor fellow is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will show you,&rsquo; said Anne.&nbsp; And explaining
in a few words what had happened, she was promptly followed by
David and Loveday along the road.&nbsp; She lifted her dress and
entered the arch with some anxiety on account of Matilda; but the
actress was gone, and Bob lay on the seat as she had left
him.</p>
<p>Bob was brought out, and water thrown upon his face; but
though he moved he did not rouse himself until some time after he
had been borne into the house.&nbsp; Here he opened his eyes, and
saw them standing round, and gathered a little consciousness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are all right, my boy!&rsquo; said his
father.&nbsp; &lsquo;What hev happened to ye?&nbsp; Where did ye
get that terrible blow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;I can mind now,&rsquo; murmured Bob, with a
stupefied gaze around.&nbsp; &lsquo;I fell in slipping down the
topsail halyard&mdash;the rope, that is, was too short&mdash;and
I fell upon my head.&nbsp; And then I went away.&nbsp; When I
came back I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t disturb ye: so I lay down
out there, to sleep out the watch; but the pain in my head was so
great that I couldn&rsquo;t get to sleep; so I picked some of the
poppy-heads in the border, which I once heard was a good thing
for sending folks to sleep when they are in pain.&nbsp; So I
munched up all I could find, and dropped off quite
nicely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wondered who had picked &rsquo;em!&rsquo; said
Molly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I noticed they were gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you might never have woke again!&rsquo; said Mrs.
Loveday, holding up her hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;How is your head
now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hardly know,&rsquo; replied the young man, putting
his hand to his forehead and beginning to doze again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where be those fellows that boarded us?&nbsp; With
this&mdash;smooth water and&mdash;fine breeze we ought to get
away from &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Haul in&mdash;the larboard braces,
and&mdash;bring her to the wind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are at home, dear Bob,&rsquo; said Anne, bending
over him, &lsquo;and the men are gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come along upstairs: th&rsquo; beest hardly awake
now,&rsquo; said his father and Bob was assisted to bed.</p>
<h2>XXXIII.&nbsp; A DISCOVERY TURNS THE SCALE</h2>
<p>In four-and-twenty hours Bob had recovered.&nbsp; But though
physically himself again, he was not at all sure of his position
as a patriot.&nbsp; He had that practical knowledge of seamanship
of which the country stood much in need, and it was humiliating
to find that impressment seemed to be necessary to teach him to
use it for her advantage.&nbsp; Many neighbouring young men, less
fortunate than himself, had been pressed and taken; and their
absence seemed a reproach to him.&nbsp; He went away by himself
into the mill-roof, and, surrounded by the corn-heaps, gave vent
to self-condemnation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, I am no man to lie here so long for the
pleasure of sighting that young girl forty times a day, and
letting her sight me&mdash;bless her eyes!&mdash;till I must
needs want a press-gang to teach me what I&rsquo;ve forgot.&nbsp;
And is it then all over with me as a British sailor?&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he was thrown under the influence of Anne&rsquo;s eyes
again, which were more tantalizingly beautiful than ever just now
(so it seemed to him), his intention of offering his services to
the Government would wax weaker, and he would put off his final
decision till the next day.&nbsp; Anne saw these fluctuations of
his mind between love and patriotism, and being terrified by what
she had heard of sea-fights, used the utmost art of which she was
capable to seduce him from his forming purpose.&nbsp; She came to
him in the mill, wearing the very prettiest of her morning
jackets&mdash;the one that only just passed the waist, and was
laced so tastefully round the collar and bosom.&nbsp; Then she
would appear in her new hat, with a bouquet of primroses on one
side; and on the following Sunday she walked before him in
lemon-coloured boots, so that her feet looked like a pair of
yellow-hammers flitting under her dress.</p>
<p>But dress was the least of the means she adopted for chaining
him down.&nbsp; She talked more tenderly than ever; asked him to
begin small undertakings in the garden on her account; she sang
about the house, that the place might seem cheerful when he came
in.&nbsp; This singing for a purpose required great effort on her
part, leaving her afterwards very sad.&nbsp; When Bob asked her
what was the matter, she would say, &lsquo;Nothing; only I am
thinking how you will grieve your father, and cross his purposes,
if you carry out your unkind notion of going to sea, and
forsaking your place in the mill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Bob would say uneasily.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
will trouble him, I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Being also quite aware how it would trouble her, he would
again postpone, and thus another week passed away.</p>
<p>All this time John had not come once to the mill.&nbsp; It
appeared as if Miss Johnson absorbed all his time and
thoughts.&nbsp; Bob was often seen chuckling over the
circumstance.&nbsp; &lsquo;A sly rascal!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pretending on the day she came to be married that she was
not good enough for me, when it was only that he wanted her for
himself.&nbsp; How he could have persuaded her to go away is
beyond me to say!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne could not contest this belief of her lover&rsquo;s, and
remained silent; but there had more than once occurred to her
mind a doubt of its probability.&nbsp; Yet she had only abandoned
her opinion that John had schemed for Matilda, to embrace the
opposite error; that, finding he had wronged the young lady, he
had pitied and grown to love her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet Jack, when he was a boy, was the simplest
fellow alive,&rsquo; resumed Bob.&nbsp; &lsquo;By George, though,
I should have been hot against him for such a trick, if in losing
her I hadn&rsquo;t found a better!&nbsp; But she&rsquo;ll never
come down to him in the world: she has high notions now.&nbsp; I
am afraid he&rsquo;s doomed to sigh in vain!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Bob regretted this possibility, the feeling was not
reciprocated by Anne.&nbsp; It was true that she knew nothing of
Matilda&rsquo;s temporary treachery, and that she disbelieved the
story of her lack of virtue; but she did not like the
woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps it will not matter if he is doomed to
sigh in vain,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I owe him no
ill-will.&nbsp; I have profited by his doings, incomprehensible
as they are.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she bent her fair eyes on Bob and
smiled.</p>
<p>Bob looked dubious.&nbsp; &lsquo;He thinks he has affronted
me, now I have seen through him, and that I shall be against
meeting him.&nbsp; But, of course, I am not so touchy.&nbsp; I
can stand a practical joke, as can any man who has been
afloat.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll call and see him, and tell him
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before he started, Bob bethought him of something which would
still further prove to the misapprehending John that he was
entirely forgiven.&nbsp; He went to his room, and took from his
chest a packet containing a lock of Miss Johnson&rsquo;s hair,
which she had given him during their brief acquaintance, and
which till now he had quite forgotten.&nbsp; When, at starting,
he wished Anne goodbye, it was accompanied by such a beaming
face, that she knew he was full of an idea, and asked what it
might be that pleased him so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, this,&rsquo; he said, smacking his
breast-pocket.&nbsp; &lsquo;A lock of hair that Matilda gave
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne sank back with parted lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to give it to Jack&mdash;he&rsquo;ll jump
for joy to get it!&nbsp; And it will show him how willing I am to
give her up to him, fine piece as she is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you see her to-day, Bob?&rsquo; Anne asked with an
uncertain smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;unless it is by accident.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On reaching the outskirts of the town he went straight to the
barracks, and was lucky enough to find John in his room, at the
left-hand corner of the quadrangle.&nbsp; John was glad to see
him; but to Bob&rsquo;s surprise he showed no immediate
contrition, and thus afforded no room for the brotherly speech of
forgiveness which Bob had been going to deliver.&nbsp; As the
trumpet-major did not open the subject, Bob felt it desirable to
begin himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have brought ye something that you will value,
Jack,&rsquo; he said, as they sat at the window, overlooking the
large square barrack-yard.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have got no further use
for it, and you should have had it before if it had entered my
head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Bob; what is it?&rsquo; said John, looking
absently at an awkward squad of young men who were drilling in
the enclosure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a young woman&rsquo;s lock of
hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said John, quite recovering from his
abstraction, and slightly flushing.&nbsp; Could Bob and Anne have
quarrelled?&nbsp; Bob drew the paper from his pocket, and opened
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Black!&rsquo; said John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;black enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Matilda&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Matilda&rsquo;s!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose did you think then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instead of replying, the trumpet-major&rsquo;s face became as
red as sunset, and he turned to the window to hide his
confusion.</p>
<p>Bob was silent, and then he, too, looked into the court.&nbsp;
At length he arose, walked to his brother, and laid his hand upon
his shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; he said, in an altered
voice, &lsquo;you are a good fellow.&nbsp; Now I see it
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no&mdash;that&rsquo;s nothing,&rsquo; said John
hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been pretending that you care for this
woman that I mightn&rsquo;t blame myself for heaving you out from
the other&mdash;which is what I&rsquo;ve done without knowing
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does it matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it does matter!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been making you
unhappy all these weeks and weeks through my
thoughtlessness.&nbsp; They seemed to think at home, you know,
John, that you had grown not to care for her; or I wouldn&rsquo;t
have done it for all the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You stick to her, Bob, and never mind me.&nbsp; She
belongs to you.&nbsp; She loves you.&nbsp; I have no claim upon
her, and she thinks nothing about me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She likes you, John, thoroughly well; so does
everybody; and if I hadn&rsquo;t come home, putting my foot in
it&mdash;&nbsp; That coming home of mine has been a regular
blight upon the family!&nbsp; I ought never to have stayed.&nbsp;
The sea is my home, and why couldn&rsquo;t I bide
there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The trumpet-major drew Bob&rsquo;s discourse off the subject
as soon as he could, and Bob, after some unconsidered replies and
remarks, seemed willing to avoid it for the present.&nbsp; He did
not ask John to accompany him home, as he had intended; and on
leaving the barracks turned southward and entered the town to
wander about till he could decide what to do.</p>
<p>It was the 3rd of September, but the King&rsquo;s
watering-place still retained its summer aspect.&nbsp; The royal
bathing-machine had been drawn out just as Bob reached Gloucester
Buildings, and he waited a minute, in the lack of other
distraction, to look on.&nbsp; Immediately that the King&rsquo;s
machine had entered the water a group of florid men with fiddles,
violoncellos, a trombone, and a drum, came forward, packed
themselves into another machine that was in waiting, and were
drawn out into the waves in the King&rsquo;s rear.&nbsp; All that
was to be heard for a few minutes were the slow pulsations of the
sea; and then a deafening noise burst from the interior of the
second machine with power enough to split the boards asunder; it
was the condensed mass of musicians inside, striking up the
strains of &lsquo;God save the King,&rsquo; as his
Majesty&rsquo;s head rose from the water.&nbsp; Bob took off his
hat and waited till the end of the performance, which, intended
as a pleasant surprise to George III. by the loyal burghers, was
possibly in the watery circumstances tolerated rather than
desired by that dripping monarch. <a name="citation303"></a><a
href="#footnote303" class="citation">[303]</a></p>
<p>Loveday then passed on to the harbour, where he remained
awhile, looking at the busy scene of loading and unloading craft
and swabbing the decks of yachts; at the boats and barges rubbing
against the quay wall, and at the houses of the merchants, some
ancient structures of solid stone, others green-shuttered with
heavy wooden bow-windows which appeared as if about to drop into
the harbour by their own weight.&nbsp; All these things he gazed
upon, and thought of one thing&mdash;that he had caused great
misery to his brother John.</p>
<p>The town clock struck, and Bob retraced his steps till he
again approached the Esplanade and Gloucester Lodge, where the
morning sun blazed in upon the house fronts, and not a spot of
shade seemed to be attainable.&nbsp; A huzzaing attracted his
attention, and he observed that a number of people had gathered
before the King&rsquo;s residence, where a brown curricle had
stopped, out of which stepped a hale man in the prime of life,
wearing a blue uniform, gilt epaulettes, cocked hat, and sword,
who crossed the pavement and went in.&nbsp; Bob went up and
joined the group.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Captain Hardy,&rsquo; replied a bystander.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What of him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just gone in&mdash;waiting to see the King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the captain is in the West Indies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; The fleet is come home; they can&rsquo;t find
the French anywhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will they go and look for them again?&rsquo; asked
Bob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes.&nbsp; Nelson is determined to find
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; As soon as he&rsquo;s refitted he&rsquo;ll put
to sea again.&nbsp; Ah, here&rsquo;s the King coming
in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob was so interested in what he had just heard that he
scarcely noticed the arrival of the King, and a body of attendant
gentlemen.&nbsp; He went on thinking of his new knowledge;
Captain Hardy was come.&nbsp; He was doubtless staying with his
family at their small manor-house at Pos&rsquo;ham, a few miles
from Overcombe, where he usually spent the intervals between his
different cruises.</p>
<p>Loveday returned to the mill without further delay; and
shortly explaining that John was very well, and would come soon,
went on to talk of the arrival of Nelson&rsquo;s captain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is he come at last?&rsquo; said the miller,
throwing his thoughts years backward.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well can I
mind when he first left home to go on board the Helena as
midshipman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not much to remember.&nbsp; I can remember
it too,&rsquo; said Mrs. Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis more than twenty years ago anyhow.&nbsp; And
more than that, I can mind when he was born; I was a lad, serving
my &lsquo;prenticeship at the time.&nbsp; He has been in this
house often and often when &lsquo;a was young.&nbsp; When he came
home after his first voyage he stayed about here a long time, and
used to look in at the mill whenever he went past.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What will you be next, sir?&rdquo; said mother to him one
day as he stood with his back to the doorpost.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
lieutenant, Dame Loveday,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what
next?&rdquo; says she.&nbsp; &ldquo;A commander.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And next?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Next,
post-captain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then it will be almost time to die.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
warrant that he&rsquo;d mind it to this very day if you were to
ask him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob heard all this with a manner of preoccupation, and soon
retired to the mill.&nbsp; Thence he went to his room by the back
passage, and taking his old seafaring garments from a dark closet
in the wall conveyed them to the loft at the top of the mill,
where he occupied the remaining spare moments of the day in
brushing the mildew from their folds, and hanging each article by
the window to get aired.&nbsp; In the evening he returned to the
loft, and dressing himself in the old salt suit, went out of the
house unobserved by anybody, and ascended the road towards
Captain Hardy&rsquo;s native village and present temporary
home.</p>
<p>The shadeless downs were now brown with the droughts of the
passing summer, and few living things met his view, the natural
rotundity of the elevation being only occasionally disturbed by
the presence of a barrow, a thorn-bush, or a piece of dry wall
which remained from some attempted enclosure.&nbsp; By the time
that he reached the village it was dark, and the larger stars had
begun to shine when he walked up to the door of the old-fashioned
house which was the family residence of this branch of the
South-Wessex Hardys.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will the captain allow me to wait on him
to-night?&rsquo; inquired Loveday, explaining who and what he
was.</p>
<p>The servant went away for a few minutes, and then told Bob
that he might see the captain in the morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll come again,&rsquo;
replied Bob, quite cheerful that failure was not absolute.</p>
<p>He had left the door but a few steps when he was called back
and asked if he had walked all the way from Overcombe Mill on
purpose.</p>
<p>Loveday replied modestly that he had done so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then will you come in?&rsquo;&nbsp; He followed the
speaker into a small study or office, and in a minute or two
Captain Hardy entered.</p>
<p>The captain at this time was a bachelor of thirty-five, rather
stout in build, with light eyes, bushy eyebrows, a square broad
face, plenty of chin, and a mouth whose corners played between
humour and grimness.&nbsp; He surveyed Loveday from top to
toe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert Loveday, sir, son of the miller at
Overcombe,&rsquo; said Bob, making a low bow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I remember your father, Loveday,&rsquo; the
gallant seaman replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, what do you want to
say to me?&rsquo;&nbsp; Seeing that Bob found it rather difficult
to begin, he leant leisurely against the mantelpiece, and went
on, &lsquo;Is your father well and hearty?&nbsp; I have not seen
him for many, many years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite well, thank &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You used to have a brother in the army, I think?&nbsp;
What was his name&mdash;John?&nbsp; A very fine fellow, if I
recollect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, cap&rsquo;n; he&rsquo;s there still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you are in the merchant-service?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Late first mate of the brig Pewit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is it you&rsquo;re not on board a
man-of-war?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, sir, that&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;ve come
about,&rsquo; said Bob, recovering confidence.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
should have been, but &rsquo;tis womankind has hampered me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve waited and waited on at home because of a young
woman&mdash;lady, I might have said, for she&rsquo;s sprung from
a higher class of society than I.&nbsp; Her father was a
landscape painter&mdash;maybe you&rsquo;ve heard of him,
sir?&nbsp; The name is Garland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He painted that view of our village here,&rsquo; said
Captain Hardy, looking towards a dark little picture in the
corner of the room.</p>
<p>Bob looked, and went on, as if to the picture, &lsquo;Well,
sir, I have found that&mdash;&nbsp; However, the press-gang came
a week or two ago, and didn&rsquo;t get hold of me.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t care to go aboard as a pressed man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There has been a severe impressment.&nbsp; It is of
course a disagreeable necessity, but it can&rsquo;t be
helped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since then, sir, something has happened that makes me
wish they had found me, and I have come to-night to ask if I
could enter on board your ship the Victory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The captain shook his head severely, and presently observed:
&lsquo;I am glad to find that you think of entering the service,
Loveday; smart men are badly wanted.&nbsp; But it will not be in
your power to choose your ship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, sir; then I must take my chance
elsewhere,&rsquo; said Bob, his face indicating the
disappointment he would not fully express.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas only that I felt I would much rather serve
under you than anybody else, my father and all of us being known
to ye, Captain Hardy, and our families belonging to the same
parts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Captain Hardy took Bob&rsquo;s altitude more carefully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Are you a good practical seaman?&rsquo; he asked
musingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, sir; I believe I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Active?&nbsp; Fond of skylarking?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know about the last.&nbsp; I think
I can say I am active enough.&nbsp; I could walk the yard-arm, if
required, cross from mast to mast by the stays, and do what most
fellows do who call themselves spry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The captain then put some questions about the details of
navigation, which Loveday, having luckily been used to square
rigs, answered satisfactorily.&nbsp; &lsquo;As to reefing
topsails,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;if I don&rsquo;t do it like a
flash of lightning, I can do it so that they will stand blowing
weather.&nbsp; The Pewit was not a dull vessel, and when we were
convoyed home from Lisbon, she could keep well in sight of the
frigate scudding at a distance, by putting on full sail.&nbsp; We
had enough hands aboard to reef topsails man-o&rsquo;-war
fashion, which is a rare thing in these days, sir, now that able
seamen are so scarce on trading craft.&nbsp; And I hear that men
from square-rigged vessels are liked much the best in the navy,
as being more ready for use?&nbsp; So that I shouldn&rsquo;t be
altogether so raw,&rsquo; said Bob earnestly, &lsquo;if I could
enter on your ship, sir.&nbsp; Still, if I can&rsquo;t, I
can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I might ask for you, Loveday,&rsquo; said the captain
thoughtfully, &lsquo;and so get you there that way.&nbsp; In
short, I think I may say I will ask for you.&nbsp; So consider it
settled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My thanks to you, sir,&rsquo; said Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are aware that the Victory is a smart ship, and
that cleanliness and order are, of necessity, more strictly
insisted upon there than in some others?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, I quite see it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I hope you will do your duty as well on a
line-of-battle ship as you did when mate of the brig, for it is a
duty that may be serious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob replied that it should be his one endeavour; and receiving
a few instructions for getting on board the guard-ship, and being
conveyed to Portsmouth, he turned to go away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have a stiff walk before you fetch
Overcombe Mill this dark night, Loveday,&rsquo; concluded the
captain, peering out of the window.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send
you in a glass of grog to help &rsquo;ee on your way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The captain then left Bob to himself, and when he had drunk
the grog that was brought in he started homeward, with a heart
not exactly light, but large with a patriotic cheerfulness, which
had not diminished when, after walking so fast in his excitement
as to be beaded with perspiration, he entered his father&rsquo;s
door.</p>
<p>They were all sitting up for him, and at his approach
anxiously raised their sleepy eyes, for it was nearly eleven
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There; I knew he&rsquo;d not be much longer!&rsquo;
cried Anne, jumping up and laughing, in her relief.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They have been thinking you were very strange and silent
to-day, Bob; you were not, were you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Bob?&rsquo; said the miller;
for Bob&rsquo;s countenance was sublimed by his recent interview,
like that of a priest just come from the penetralia of the
temple.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s in his mate&rsquo;s clothes, just as when he
came home!&rsquo; observed Mrs. Loveday.</p>
<p>They all saw now that he had something to tell.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am going away,&rsquo; he said when he had sat down.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am going to enter on board a man-of-war, and perhaps it
will be the Victory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going?&rsquo; said Anne faintly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you mind it, there&rsquo;s a
dear,&rsquo; he went on solemnly, taking her hand in his
own.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you, father, don&rsquo;t you begin to take
it to heart&rsquo; (the miller was looking grave).&nbsp;
&lsquo;The press-gang has been here, and though I showed them
that I was a free man, I am going to show everybody that I can do
my duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Neither of the other three answered, Anne and the miller
having their eyes bent upon the ground, and the former trying to
repress her tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t you grieve, either of you,&rsquo; he
continued; &lsquo;nor vex yourselves that this has
happened.&nbsp; Please not to be angry with me, father, for
deserting you and the mill, where you want me, for I <i>must
go</i>.&nbsp; For these three years we and the rest of the
country have been in fear of the enemy; trade has been hindered;
poor folk made hungry; and many rich folk made poor.&nbsp; There
must be a deliverance, and it must be done by sea.&nbsp; I have
seen Captain Hardy, and I shall serve under him if so be I
can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Captain Hardy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I have been to his house at Pos&rsquo;ham,
where he&rsquo;s staying with his sisters; walked there and back,
and I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed it for fifty guineas.&nbsp; I
hardly thought he would see me; but he did see me.&nbsp; And he
hasn&rsquo;t forgot you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob then opened his tale in order, relating graphically the
conversation to which he had been a party, and they listened with
breathless attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you must go, you must,&rsquo; said the miller
with emotion; &lsquo;but I think it somewhat hard that, of my two
sons, neither one of &rsquo;em can be got to stay and help me in
my business as I get old.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble and vex about it,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Loveday soothingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are both instruments in the
hands of Providence, chosen to chastise that Corsican ogre, and
do what they can for the country in these trying
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s just the shape of it, Mrs. Loveday,&rsquo;
said Bob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he&rsquo;ll come back soon,&rsquo; she continued,
turning to Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;And then he&rsquo;ll tell us all he
has seen, and the glory that he&rsquo;s won, and how he has
helped to sweep that scourge Buonaparty off the earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When be you going, Bob?&rsquo; his father inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow, if I can.&nbsp; I shall call at the barracks
and tell John as I go by.&nbsp; When I get to
Portsmouth&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>A burst of sobs in quick succession interrupted his words;
they came from Anne, who till that moment had been sitting as
before with her hand in that of Bob, and apparently quite
calm.&nbsp; Mrs. Loveday jumped up, but before she could say
anything to soothe the agitated girl she had calmed herself with
the same singular suddenness that had marked her giving
way.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind Bob&rsquo;s going,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think he ought to go.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
suppose, Bob, that I want you to stay!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this she left the apartment, and went into the little
side room where she and her mother usually worked.&nbsp; In a few
moments Bob followed her.&nbsp; When he came back he was in a
very sad and emotional mood.&nbsp; Anybody could see that there
had been a parting of profound anguish to both.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is not coming back to-night,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will see her to-morrow before you go?&rsquo; said
her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may or I may not,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Father and Mrs. Loveday, do you go to bed now.&nbsp; I
have got to look over my things and get ready; and it will take
me some little time.&nbsp; If you should hear noises you will
know it is only myself moving about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Bob was left alone he suddenly became brisk, and set
himself to overhaul his clothes and other possessions in a
business-like manner.&nbsp; By the time that his chest was
packed, such things as he meant to leave at home folded into
cupboards, and what was useless destroyed, it was past two
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Then he went to bed, so softly that only the
creak of one weak stair revealed his passage upward.&nbsp; At the
moment that he passed Anne&rsquo;s chamber-door her mother was
bending over her as she lay in bed, and saying to her,
&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you see him in the morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would rather
not see him!&nbsp; I have said that I may.&nbsp; But I shall
not.&nbsp; I cannot see him again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the family got up next day Bob had vanished.&nbsp; It was
his way to disappear like this, to avoid affecting scenes at
parting.&nbsp; By the time that they had sat down to a gloomy
breakfast, Bob was in the boat of a Budmouth waterman, who pulled
him alongside the guardship in the roads, where he laid hold of
the man-rope, mounted, and disappeared from external view.&nbsp;
In the course of the day the ship moved off, set her royals, and
made sail for Portsmouth, with five hundred new hands for the
service on board, consisting partly of pressed men and partly of
volunteers, among the latter being Robert Loveday.</p>
<h2>XXXIV.&nbsp; A SPECK ON THE SEA</h2>
<p>In parting from John, who accompanied him to the quay, Bob had
said: &lsquo;Now, Jack, these be my last words to you: I give her
up.&nbsp; I go away on purpose, and I shall be away a long
time.&nbsp; If in that time she should list over towards ye ever
so little, mind you take her.&nbsp; You have more right to her
than I.&nbsp; You chose her when my mind was elsewhere, and you
best deserve her; for I have never known you forget one woman,
while I&rsquo;ve forgot a dozen.&nbsp; Take her then, if she will
come, and God bless both of ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another person besides John saw Bob go.&nbsp; That was
Derriman, who was standing by a bollard a little further up the
quay.&nbsp; He did not repress his satisfaction at the
sight.&nbsp; John looked towards him with an open gaze of
contempt; for the cuffs administered to the yeoman at the inn had
not, so far as the trumpet-major was aware, produced any desire
to avenge that insult, John being, of course, quite ignorant that
Festus had erroneously retaliated upon Bob, in his peculiar
though scarcely soldierly way.&nbsp; Finding that he did not even
now approach him, John went on his way, and thought over his
intention of preserving intact the love between Anne and his
brother.</p>
<p>He was surprised when he next went to the mill to find how
glad they all were to see him.&nbsp; From the moment of
Bob&rsquo;s return to the bosom of the deep Anne had had no
existence on land; people might have looked at her human body and
said she had flitted thence.&nbsp; The sea and all that belonged
to the sea was her daily thought and her nightly dream.&nbsp; She
had the whole two-and-thirty winds under her eye, each passing
gale that ushered in returning autumn being mentally registered;
and she acquired a precise knowledge of the direction in which
Portsmouth, Brest, Ferrol, Cadiz, and other such likely places
lay.&nbsp; Instead of saying her own familiar prayers at night
she substituted, with some confusion of thought, the Forms of
Prayer to be used at sea.&nbsp; John at once noticed her lorn,
abstracted looks, pitied her,&mdash;how much he pitied
her!&mdash;and asked when they were alone if there was anything
he could do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are two things,&rsquo; she said, with almost
childish eagerness in her tired eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They shall be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The first is to find out if Captain Hardy has gone back
to his ship; and the other is&mdash;O if you will do it,
John!&mdash;to get me newspapers whenever possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this duologue John was absent for a space of three
hours, and they thought he had gone back to barracks.&nbsp; He
entered, however, at the end of that time, took off his
forage-cap, and wiped his forehead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You look tired, John,&rsquo; said his father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no.&rsquo;&nbsp; He went through the house till he
had found Anne Garland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have only done one of those things,&rsquo; he said to
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, already!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t hope for or mean
to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Captain Hardy is gone from Pos&rsquo;ham.&nbsp; He left
some days ago.&nbsp; We shall soon hear that the fleet has
sailed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been all the way to Pos&rsquo;ham on
purpose?&nbsp; How good of you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I was anxious to know myself when Bob is likely
to leave.&nbsp; I expect now that we shall soon hear from
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two days later he came again.&nbsp; He brought a newspaper,
and what was better, a letter for Anne, franked by the first
lieutenant of the Victory.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he&rsquo;s aboard her,&rsquo; said Anne, as she
eagerly took the letter.</p>
<p>It was short, but as much as she could expect in the
circumstances, and informed them that the captain had been as
good as his word, and had gratified Bob&rsquo;s earnest wish to
serve under him.&nbsp; The ship, with Admiral Lord Nelson on
board, and accompanied by the frigate Euryalus, was to sail in
two days for Plymouth, where they would be joined by others, and
thence proceed to the coast of Spain.</p>
<p>Anne lay awake that night thinking of the Victory, and of
those who floated in her.&nbsp; To the best of Anne&rsquo;s
calculation that ship of war would, during the next twenty-four
hours, pass within a few miles of where she herself then
lay.&nbsp; Next to seeing Bob, the thing that would give her more
pleasure than any other in the world was to see the vessel that
contained him&mdash;his floating city, his sole dependence in
battle and storm&mdash;upon whose safety from winds and enemies
hung all her hope.</p>
<p>The morrow was market-day at the seaport, and in this she saw
her opportunity.&nbsp; A carrier went from Overcombe at six
o&rsquo;clock thither, and having to do a little shopping for
herself she gave it as a reason for her intended day&rsquo;s
absence, and took a place in the van.&nbsp; When she reached the
town it was still early morning, but the borough was already in
the zenith of its daily bustle and show.&nbsp; The King was
always out-of-doors by six o&rsquo;clock, and such cock-crow
hours at Gloucester Lodge produced an equally forward stir among
the population.&nbsp; She alighted, and passed down the
esplanade, as fully thronged by persons of fashion at this time
of mist and level sunlight as a watering-place in the present day
is at four in the afternoon.&nbsp; Dashing bucks and beaux in
cocked hats, black feathers, ruffles, and frills, stared at her
as she hurried along; the beach was swarming with bathing women,
wearing waistbands that bore the national refrain, &lsquo;God
save the King,&rsquo; in gilt letters; the shops were all open,
and Sergeant Stanner, with his sword-stuck bank-notes and heroic
gaze, was beating up at two guineas and a crown, the crown to
drink his Majesty&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>She soon finished her shopping, and then, crossing over into
the old town, pursued her way along the coast-road to
Portland.&nbsp; At the end of an hour she had been rowed across
the Fleet (which then lacked the convenience of a bridge), and
reached the base of Portland Hill.&nbsp; The steep incline before
her was dotted with houses, showing the pleasant peculiarity of
one man&rsquo;s doorstep being behind his neighbour&rsquo;s
chimney, and slabs of stone as the common material for walls,
roof, floor, pig-sty, stable-manger, door-scraper, and
garden-stile.&nbsp; Anne gained the summit, and followed along
the central track over the huge lump of freestone which forms the
peninsula, the wide sea prospect extending as she went on.&nbsp;
Weary with her journey, she approached the extreme southerly peak
of rock, and gazed from the cliff at Portland Bill, or Beal, as
it was in those days more correctly called.</p>
<p>The wild, herbless, weather-worn promontory was quite a
solitude, and, saving the one old lighthouse about fifty yards up
the slope, scarce a mark was visible to show that humanity had
ever been near the spot.&nbsp; Anne found herself a seat on a
stone, and swept with her eyes the tremulous expanse of water
around her that seemed to utter a ceaseless unintelligible
incantation.&nbsp; Out of the three hundred and sixty degrees of
her complete horizon two hundred and fifty were covered by waves,
the coup d&rsquo;oeil including the area of troubled waters known
as the Race, where two seas met to effect the destruction of such
vessels as could not be mastered by one.&nbsp; She counted the
craft within her view: there were five; no, there were only four;
no, there were seven, some of the specks having resolved
themselves into two.&nbsp; They were all small coasters, and kept
well within sight of land.</p>
<p>Anne sank into a reverie.&nbsp; Then she heard a slight noise
on her left hand, and turning beheld an old sailor, who had
approached with a glass.&nbsp; He was levelling it over the sea
in a direction to the south-east, and somewhat removed from that
in which her own eyes had been wandering.&nbsp; Anne moved a few
steps thitherward, so as to unclose to her view a deeper sweep on
that side, and by this discovered a ship of far larger size than
any which had yet dotted the main before her.&nbsp; Its sails
were for the most part new and clean, and in comparison with its
rapid progress before the wind the small brigs and ketches seemed
standing still.&nbsp; Upon this striking object the old
man&rsquo;s glass was bent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you see, sailor?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Almost nothing,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
sight is so gone off lately that things, one and all, be but a
November mist to me.&nbsp; And yet I fain would see to-day.&nbsp;
I am looking for the Victory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; she said quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a son aboard her.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s one of three
from these parts.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the captain, there&rsquo;s
my son Ned, and there&rsquo;s young Loveday of Overcombe&mdash;he
that lately joined.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I look for you?&rsquo; said Anne, after a
pause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, mis&rsquo;ess, if so be you
please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne took the glass, and he supported it by his arm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is a large ship,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;with three
masts, three rows of guns along the side, and all her sails
set.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I guessed as much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a little flag in front&mdash;over her
bowsprit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The jack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there&rsquo;s a large one flying at her
stern.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ensign.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a white one on her fore-topmast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the admiral&rsquo;s flag, the flag of my
Lord Nelson.&nbsp; What is her figure-head, my dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A coat-of-arms, supported on this side by a
sailor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her companion nodded with satisfaction.&nbsp; &lsquo;On the
other side of that figure-head is a marine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is twisting round in a curious way, and her sails
sink in like old cheeks, and she shivers like a leaf upon a
tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is in stays, for the larboard tack.&nbsp; I can see
what she&rsquo;s been doing.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been
re&rsquo;ching close in to avoid the flood tide, as the wind is
to the sou&rsquo;-west, and she&rsquo;s bound down; but as soon
as the ebb made, d&rsquo;ye see, they made sail to the
west&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; Captain Hardy may be depended upon for
that; he knows every current about here, being a
native.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now I can see the other side; it is a soldier where
a sailor was before.&nbsp; You are <i>sure</i> it is the
Victory?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this a frigate came into view&mdash;the
Euryalus&mdash;sailing in the same direction.&nbsp; Anne sat
down, and her eyes never left the ships.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell me
more about the Victory,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is the best sailer in the service, and she carries
a hundred guns.&nbsp; The heaviest be on the lower deck, the next
size on the middle deck, the next on the main and upper
decks.&nbsp; My son Ned&rsquo;s place is on the lower deck,
because he&rsquo;s short, and they put the short men
below.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob, though not tall, was not likely to be specially selected
for shortness.&nbsp; She pictured him on the upper deck, in his
snow-white trousers and jacket of navy blue, looking perhaps
towards the very point of land where she then was.</p>
<p>The great silent ship, with her population of blue-jackets,
marines, officers, captain, and the admiral who was not to return
alive, passed like a phantom the meridian of the Bill.&nbsp;
Sometimes her aspect was that of a large white bat, sometimes
that of a grey one.&nbsp; In the course of time the watching girl
saw that the ship had passed her nearest point; the breadth of
her sails diminished by foreshortening, till she assumed the form
of an egg on end.&nbsp; After this something seemed to twinkle,
and Anne, who had previously withdrawn from the old sailor, went
back to him, and looked again through the glass.&nbsp; The
twinkling was the light falling upon the cabin windows of the
ship&rsquo;s stern.&nbsp; She explained it to the old man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then we see now what the enemy have seen but
once.&nbsp; That was in seventy-nine, when she sighted the French
and Spanish fleet off Scilly, and she retreated because she
feared a landing.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis a brave ship and she
carries brave men!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s tender bosom heaved, but she said nothing, and
again became absorbed in contemplation.</p>
<p>The Victory was fast dropping away.&nbsp; She was on the
horizon, and soon appeared hull down.&nbsp; That seemed to be
like the beginning of a greater end than her present
vanishing.&nbsp; Anne Garland could not stay by the sailor any
longer, and went about a stone&rsquo;s-throw off, where she was
hidden by the inequality of the cliff from his view.&nbsp; The
vessel was now exactly end on, and stood out in the direction of
the Start, her width having contracted to the proportion of a
feather.&nbsp; She sat down again, and mechanically took out some
biscuits that she had brought, foreseeing that her waiting might
be long.&nbsp; But she could not eat one of them; eating seemed
to jar with the mental tenseness of the moment; and her
undeviating gaze continued to follow the lessened ship with the
fidelity of a balanced needle to a magnetic stone, all else in
her being motionless.</p>
<p>The courses of the Victory were absorbed into the main, then
her topsails went, and then her top-gallants.&nbsp; She was now
no more than a dead fly&rsquo;s wing on a sheet of spider&rsquo;s
web; and even this fragment diminished.&nbsp; Anne could hardly
bear to see the end, and yet she resolved not to flinch.&nbsp;
The admiral&rsquo;s flag sank behind the watery line, and in a
minute the very truck of the last topmast stole away.&nbsp; The
Victory was gone.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s lip quivered as she murmured, without removing
her wet eyes from the vacant and solemn horizon,
&lsquo;&ldquo;They that go down to the sea in ships, that do
business in great waters&mdash;&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;These see the works of the Lord, and His wonders
in the deep,&rdquo;&rsquo; was returned by a man&rsquo;s voice
from behind her.</p>
<p>Looking round quickly, she saw a soldier standing there; and
the grave eyes of John Loveday bent on her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis what I was thinking,&rsquo; she said, trying
to be composed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were saying it,&rsquo; he answered gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was I?&mdash;I did not know it. . . .&nbsp; How came
you here?&rsquo; she presently added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been behind you a good while; but you never
turned round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was deeply occupied,&rsquo; she said in an
undertone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;I too came to see him pass.&nbsp; I heard
this morning that Lord Nelson had embarked, and I knew at once
that they would sail immediately.&nbsp; The Victory and Euryalus
are to join the rest of the fleet at Plymouth.&nbsp; There was a
great crowd of people assembled to see the admiral off; they
cheered him and the ship as she dropped down.&nbsp; He took his
coffin on board with him, they say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His coffin!&rsquo; said Anne, turning deadly
pale.&nbsp; &lsquo;Something terrible, then, is meant by
that!&nbsp; O, why <i>would</i> Bob go in that ship? doomed to
destruction from the very beginning like this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was his determination to sail under Captain Hardy,
and under no one else,&rsquo; said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;There may
be hot work; but we must hope for the best.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
observing how wretched she looked, he added, &lsquo;But
won&rsquo;t you let me help you back?&nbsp; If you can walk as
far as Hope Cove it will be enough.&nbsp; A lerret is going from
there across the bay homeward to the harbour in the course of an
hour; it belongs to a man I know, and they can take one
passenger, I am sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned her back upon the Channel, and by his help soon
reached the place indicated.&nbsp; The boat was lying there as he
had said.&nbsp; She found it to belong to the old man who had
been with her at the Bill, and was in charge of his two younger
sons.&nbsp; The trumpet-major helped her into it over the
slippery blocks of stone, one of the young men spread his jacket
for her to sit on, and as soon as they pulled from shore John
climbed up the blue-grey cliff, and disappeared over the top, to
return to the mainland by road.</p>
<p>Anne was in the town by three o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The trip in
the stern of the lerret had quite refreshed her, with the help of
the biscuits, which she had at last been able to eat.&nbsp; The
van from the port to Overcombe did not start till four
o&rsquo;clock, and feeling no further interest in the gaieties of
the place, she strolled on past the King&rsquo;s house to the
outskirts, her mind settling down again upon the possibly sad
fate of the Victory when she found herself alone.&nbsp; She did
not hurry on; and finding that even now there wanted another
half-hour to the carrier&rsquo;s time, she turned into a little
lane to escape the inspection of the numerous passers-by.&nbsp;
Here all was quite lonely and still, and she sat down under a
willow-tree, absently regarding the landscape, which had begun to
put on the rich tones of declining summer, but which to her was
as hollow and faded as a theatre by day.&nbsp; She could hold out
no longer; burying her face in her hands, she wept without
restraint.</p>
<p>Some yards behind her was a little spring of water, having a
stone margin round it to prevent the cattle from treading in the
sides and filling it up with dirt.&nbsp; While she wept, two
elderly gentlemen entered unperceived upon the scene, and walked
on to the spring&rsquo;s brink.&nbsp; Here they paused and looked
in, afterwards moving round it, and then stooping as if to smell
or taste its waters.&nbsp; The spring was, in fact, a sulphurous
one, then recently discovered by a physician who lived in the
neighbourhood; and it was beginning to attract some attention,
having by common report contributed to effect such wonderful
cures as almost passed belief.&nbsp; After a considerable
discussion, apparently on how the pool might be improved for
better use, one of the two elderly gentlemen turned away, leaving
the other still probing the spring with his cane.&nbsp; The first
stranger, who wore a blue coat with gilt buttons, came on in the
direction of Anne Garland, and seeing her sad posture went
quickly up to her, and said abruptly, &lsquo;What is the
matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne, who in her grief had observed nothing of the
gentlemen&rsquo;s presence, withdrew her handkerchief from her
eyes and started to her feet.&nbsp; She instantly recognised her
interrogator as the King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, what, crying?&rsquo; his Majesty inquired
kindly.&nbsp; &lsquo;How is this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;have seen a dear friend go away, sir,&rsquo;
she faltered, with downcast eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;partings are sad&mdash;very sad&mdash;for us
all.&nbsp; You must hope your friend will return soon.&nbsp;
Where is he or she gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, your Majesty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know&mdash;how is that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a sailor on board the Victory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he has reason to be proud,&rsquo; said the King
with interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is your brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne tried to explain what he was, but could not, and blushed
with painful heat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, well; what is his name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In spite of Anne&rsquo;s confusion and low spirits, her
womanly shrewdness told her at once that no harm could be done by
revealing Bob&rsquo;s name; and she answered, &lsquo;His name is
Robert Loveday, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Loveday&mdash;a good name.&nbsp; I shall not forget
it.&nbsp; Now dry your cheeks, and don&rsquo;t cry any
more.&nbsp; Loveday&mdash;Robert Loveday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne curtseyed, the King smiled good-humouredly, and turned to
rejoin his companion, who was afterwards heard to be Dr. ---, the
physician in attendance at Gloucester Lodge.&nbsp; This gentleman
had in the meantime filled a small phial with the medicinal
water, which he carefully placed in his pocket; and on the King
coming up they retired together and disappeared.&nbsp; Thereupon
Anne, now thoroughly aroused, followed the same way with a
gingerly tread, just in time to see them get into a carriage
which was in waiting at the turning of the lane.</p>
<p>She quite forgot the carrier, and everything else in connexion
with riding home.&nbsp; Flying along the road rapidly and
unconsciously, when she awoke to a sense of her whereabouts she
was so near to Overcombe as to make the carrier not worth waiting
for.&nbsp; She had been borne up in this hasty spurt at the end
of a weary day by visions of Bob promoted to the rank of admiral,
or something equally wonderful, by the King&rsquo;s special
command, the chief result of the promotion being, in her
arrangement of the piece, that he would stay at home and go to
sea no more.&nbsp; But she was not a girl who indulged in
extravagant fancies long, and before she reached home she thought
that the King had probably forgotten her by that time, and her
troubles, and her lover&rsquo;s name.</p>
<h2>XXXV.&nbsp; A SAILOR ENTERS</h2>
<p>The remaining fortnight of the month of September passed away,
with a general decline from the summer&rsquo;s excitements.&nbsp;
The royal family left the watering-place the first week in
October, the German Legion with their artillery about the same
time.&nbsp; The dragoons still remained at the barracks just out
of the town, and John Loveday brought to Anne every newspaper
that he could lay hands on, especially such as contained any
fragment of shipping news.&nbsp; This threw them much together;
and at these times John was often awkward and confused, on
account of the unwonted stress of concealing his great love for
her.</p>
<p>Her interests had grandly developed from the limits of
Overcombe and the town life hard by, to an extensiveness truly
European.&nbsp; During the whole month of October, however, not a
single grain of information reached her, or anybody else,
concerning Nelson and his blockading squadron off Cadiz.&nbsp;
There were the customary bad jokes about Buonaparte, especially
when it was found that the whole French army had turned its back
upon Boulogne and set out for the Rhine.&nbsp; Then came accounts
of his march through Germany and into Austria; but not a word
about the Victory.</p>
<p>At the beginning of autumn John brought news which fearfully
depressed her.&nbsp; The Austrian General Mack had capitulated
with his whole army.&nbsp; Then were revived the old misgivings
as to invasion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Instead of having to cope with him
weary with waiting, we shall have to encounter This Man fresh
from the fields of victory,&rsquo; ran the newspaper article.</p>
<p>But the week which had led off with such a dreary piping was
to end in another key.&nbsp; On the very day when Mack&rsquo;s
army was piling arms at the feet of its conqueror, a blow had
been struck by Bob Loveday and his comrades which eternally
shattered the enemy&rsquo;s force by sea.&nbsp; Four days after
the receipt of the Austrian news Corporal Tullidge ran into the
miller&rsquo;s house to inform him that on the previous Monday,
at eleven in the morning, the Pickle schooner, Lieutenant
Lapenotiere, had arrived at Falmouth with despatches from the
fleet; that the stage-coaches on the highway through Wessex to
London were chalked with the words &lsquo;Great Victory!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Glorious Triumph!&rsquo; and so on; and that all the
country people were wild to know particulars.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon John arrived with authentic news of the
battle off Cape Trafalgar, and the death of Nelson.&nbsp; Captain
Hardy was alive, though his escape had been narrow enough, his
shoe-buckle having been carried away by a shot.&nbsp; It was
feared that the Victory had been the scene of the heaviest
slaughter among all the ships engaged, but as yet no returns of
killed and wounded had been issued, beyond a rough list of the
numbers in some of the ships.</p>
<p>The suspense of the little household in Overcombe Mill was
great in the extreme.&nbsp; John came thither daily for more than
a week; but no further particulars reached England till the end
of that time, and then only the meagre intelligence that there
had been a gale immediately after the battle, and that many of
the prizes had been lost.&nbsp; Anne said little to all these
things, and preserved a superstratum of calmness on her
countenance; but some inner voice seemed to whisper to her that
Bob was no more.&nbsp; Miller Loveday drove to Pos&rsquo;ham
several times to learn if the Captain&rsquo;s sisters had
received any more definite tidings than these flying reports; but
that family had heard nothing which could in any way relieve the
miller&rsquo;s anxiety.&nbsp; When at last, at the end of
November, there appeared a final and revised list of killed and
wounded as issued by Admiral Collingwood, it was a useless sheet
to the Lovedays.&nbsp; To their great pain it contained no names
but those of officers, the friends of ordinary seamen and marines
being in those good old days left to discover their losses as
best they might.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s conviction of her loss increased with the
darkening of the early winter time.&nbsp; Bob was not a cautious
man who would avoid needless exposure, and a hundred and fifty of
the Victory&rsquo;s crew had been disabled or slain.&nbsp;
Anybody who had looked into her room at this time would have seen
that her favourite reading was the office for the Burial of the
Dead at Sea, beginning &lsquo;We therefore commit his body to the
deep.&rsquo;&nbsp; In these first days of December several of the
victorious fleet came into port; but not the Victory.&nbsp; Many
supposed that that noble ship, disabled by the battle, had gone
to the bottom in the subsequent tempestuous weather; and the
belief was persevered in till it was told in the town and port
that she had been seen passing up the Channel.&nbsp; Two days
later the Victory arrived at Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Then letters from survivors began to appear in the public
prints which John so regularly brought to Anne; but though he
watched the mails with unceasing vigilance there was never a
letter from Bob.&nbsp; It sometimes crossed John&rsquo;s mind
that his brother might still be alive and well, and that in his
wish to abide by his expressed intention of giving up Anne and
home life he was deliberately lax in writing.&nbsp; If so, Bob
was carrying out the idea too thoughtlessly by half, as could be
seen by watching the effects of suspense upon the fair face of
the victim, and the anxiety of the rest of the family.</p>
<p>It was a clear day in December.&nbsp; The first slight snow of
the season had been sifted over the earth, and one side of the
apple-tree branches in the miller&rsquo;s garden was touched with
white, though a few leaves were still lingering on the tops of
the younger trees.&nbsp; A short sailor of the Royal Navy, who
was not Bob, nor anything like him, crossed the mill court and
came to the door.&nbsp; The miller hastened out and brought him
into the room, where John, Mrs. Loveday, and Anne Garland were
all present.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m from aboard the Victory,&rsquo; said the
sailor.&nbsp; &lsquo;My name&rsquo;s Jim Cornick.&nbsp; And your
lad is alive and well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They breathed rather than spoke their thankfulness and relief,
the miller&rsquo;s eyes being moist as he turned aside to calm
himself; while Anne, having first jumped up wildly from her seat,
sank back again under the almost insupportable joy that trembled
through her limbs to her utmost finger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come from Spithead to Pos&rsquo;ham,&rsquo;
the sailor continued, &lsquo;and now I am going on to father at
Budmouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&mdash;I know your father,&rsquo; cried the
trumpet-major, &lsquo;old James Cornick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the man who had brought Anne in his lerret from
Portland Bill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Bob hasn&rsquo;t got a scratch?&rsquo; said the
miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a scratch,&rsquo; said Cornick.</p>
<p>Loveday then bustled off to draw the visitor something to
drink.&nbsp; Anne Garland, with a glowing blush on her face, had
gone to the back part of the room, where she was the very
embodiment of sweet content as she slightly swayed herself
without speaking.&nbsp; A little tide of happiness seemed to ebb
and flow through her in listening to the sailor&rsquo;s words,
moving her figure with it.&nbsp; The seaman and John went on
conversing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bob had a good deal to do with barricading the
hawse-holes afore we were in action, and the Adm&rsquo;l and
Cap&rsquo;n both were very much pleased at how &rsquo;twas
done.&nbsp; When the Adm&rsquo;l went up the quarter-deck ladder,
Cap&rsquo;n Hardy said a word or two to Bob, but what it was I
don&rsquo;t know, for I was quartered at a gun some ways
off.&nbsp; However, Bob saw the Adm&rsquo;l stagger when &lsquo;a
was wownded, and was one of the men who carried him to the
cockpit.&nbsp; After that he and some other lads jumped aboard
the French ship, and I believe they was in her when she struck
her flag.&nbsp; What &lsquo;a did next I can&rsquo;t say, for the
wind had dropped, and the smoke was like a cloud.&nbsp; But
&lsquo;a got a good deal talked about; and they say there&rsquo;s
promotion in store for&rsquo;n.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this point in the story Jim Cornick stopped to drink, and a
low unconscious humming came from Anne in her distant corner; the
faint melody continued more or less when the conversation between
the sailor and the Lovedays was renewed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We heard afore that the Victory was near knocked to
pieces,&rsquo; said the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Knocked to pieces?&nbsp; You&rsquo;d say so if so be
you could see her!&nbsp; Gad, her sides be battered like an old
penny piece; the shot be still sticking in her wales, and her
sails be like so many clap-nets: we have run all the way home
under jury topmasts; and as for her decks, you may swab wi&rsquo;
hot water, and you may swab wi&rsquo; cold, but there&rsquo;s the
blood-stains, and there they&rsquo;ll bide. . . .&nbsp; The
Cap&rsquo;n had a narrow escape, like many o&rsquo; the
rest&mdash;a shot shaved his ankle like a razor.&nbsp; You should
have seen that man&rsquo;s face in the het o&rsquo; battle, his
features were as if they&rsquo;d been cast in steel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We rather expected a letter from Bob before
this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Jim Cornick, with a smile of
toleration, &lsquo;you must make allowances.&nbsp; The truth
o&rsquo;t is, he&rsquo;s engaged just now at Portsmouth, like a
good many of the rest from our ship. . . .&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
very nice young woman that he&rsquo;s a courting of, and I make
no doubt that she&rsquo;ll be an excellent wife for
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mrs. Loveday, in a warning tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Courting&mdash;wife?&rsquo; said the miller.</p>
<p>They instinctively looked towards Anne.&nbsp; Anne had started
as if shaken by an invisible hand, and a thick mist of doubt
seemed to obscure the intelligence of her eyes.&nbsp; This was
but for two or three moments.&nbsp; Very pale, she arose and went
right up to the seaman.&nbsp; John gently tried to intercept her,
but she passed him by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you speak of Robert Loveday as courting a
wife?&rsquo; she asked, without the least betrayal of
emotion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t see you, miss,&rsquo; replied Cornick,
turning.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, your brother hev&rsquo; his eye on a
wife, and he deserves one.&nbsp; I hope you don&rsquo;t
mind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not in the least,&rsquo; she said, with a stage
laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am interested, naturally.&nbsp; And what is
she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very nice young master-baker&rsquo;s daughter,
honey.&nbsp; A very wise choice of the young
man&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she fair or dark?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her hair is rather light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like light hair; and her name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her name is Caroline.&nbsp; But can it be that my story
hurts ye?&nbsp; If so&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said John, interposing
anxiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t care for more just at this
moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We <i>do</i> care for more!&rsquo; said Anne
vehemently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell it all, sailor.&nbsp; That is a
very pretty name, Caroline.&nbsp; When are they going to be
married?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know as how the day is settled,&rsquo;
answered Jim, even now scarcely conscious of the devastation he
was causing in one fair breast.&nbsp; &lsquo;But from the rate
the courting is scudding along at, I should say it won&rsquo;t be
long first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you see him when you go back, give him my best
wishes,&rsquo; she lightly said, as she moved away.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And,&rsquo; she added, with solemn bitterness, &lsquo;say
that I am glad to hear he is making such good use of the first
days of his escape from the Valley of the Shadow of
Death!&rsquo;&nbsp; She went away, expressing indifference by
audibly singing in the distance&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Shall we go dance the round, the round, the
round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall we go dance the round?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Your sister is lively at the news,&rsquo; observed Jim
Cornick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; murmured John gloomily, as he gnawed his
lower lip and kept his eyes fixed on the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; continued the man from the Victory,
&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t say that your brother&rsquo;s intended
ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got some ballast, which is very lucky
for&rsquo;n, as he might have picked up with a girl without a
single copper nail.&nbsp; To be sure there was a time we had when
we got into port!&nbsp; It was open house for us
all!&rsquo;&nbsp; And after mentally regarding the scene for a
few seconds Jim emptied his cup and rose to go.</p>
<p>The miller was saying some last words to him outside the
house, Anne&rsquo;s voice had hardly ceased singing upstairs,
John was standing by the fireplace, and Mrs. Loveday was crossing
the room to join her daughter, whose manner had given her some
uneasiness, when a noise came from above the ceiling, as of some
heavy body falling.&nbsp; Mrs. Loveday rushed to the staircase,
saying, &lsquo;Ah, I feared something!&rsquo; and she was
followed by John.</p>
<p>When they entered Anne&rsquo;s room, which they both did
almost at one moment, they found her lying insensible upon the
floor.&nbsp; The trumpet-major, his lips tightly closed, lifted
her in his arms, and laid her upon the bed; after which he went
back to the door to give room to her mother, who was bending over
the girl with some hartshorn.</p>
<p>Presently Mrs. Loveday looked up and said to him, &lsquo;She
is only in a faint, John, and her colour is coming back.&nbsp;
Now leave her to me; I will be downstairs in a few minutes, and
tell you how she is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John left the room.&nbsp; When he gained the lower apartment
his father was standing by the chimney-piece, the sailor having
gone.&nbsp; The trumpet-major went up to the fire, and, grasping
the edge of the high chimney-shelf, stood silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I hear a noise when I went out?&rsquo; asked the
elder, in a tone of misgiving.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you did,&rsquo; said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was
she, but her mother says she is better now.&nbsp; Father,&rsquo;
he added impetuously, &lsquo;Bob is a worthless blockhead!&nbsp;
If there had been any good in him he would have been drowned
years ago!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;John, John&mdash;not too fast,&rsquo; said the
miller.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a hard thing to say of your
brother, and you ought to be ashamed of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he tries me more than I can bear.&nbsp; Good God!
what can a man be made of to go on as he does?&nbsp; Why
didn&rsquo;t he come home; or if he couldn&rsquo;t get leave why
didn&rsquo;t he write?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis scandalous of him to
serve a woman like that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gently, gently.&nbsp; The chap hev done his duty as a
sailor; and though there might have been something between him
and Anne, her mother, in talking it over with me, has said many
times that she couldn&rsquo;t think of their marrying till Bob
had settled down in business with me.&nbsp; Folks that gain
victories must have a little liberty allowed &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
Look at the Admiral himself, for that matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John continued looking at the red coals, till hearing Mrs.
Loveday&rsquo;s foot on the staircase, he went to meet her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is better,&rsquo; said Mrs. Loveday; &lsquo;but she
won&rsquo;t come down again to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Could John have heard what the poor girl was moaning to
herself at that moment as she lay writhing on the bed, he would
have doubted her mother&rsquo;s assurance.&nbsp; &lsquo;If he had
been dead I could have borne it, but this I cannot
bear!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>XXXVI.&nbsp; DERRIMAN SEES CHANCES</h2>
<p>Meanwhile Sailor Cornick had gone on his way as far as the
forking roads, where he met Festus Derriman on foot.&nbsp; The
latter, attracted by the seaman&rsquo;s dress, and by seeing him
come from the mill, at once accosted him.&nbsp; Jim, with the
greatest readiness, fell into conversation, and told the same
story as that he had related at the mill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bob Loveday going to be married?&rsquo; repeated
Festus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You all seem struck of a heap wi&rsquo;
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I never heard news that pleased me more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Cornick was gone, Festus, instead of passing straight on,
halted on the little bridge and meditated.&nbsp; Bob, being now
interested elsewhere, would probably not resent the siege of
Anne&rsquo;s heart by another; there could, at any rate, be no
further possibility of that looming duel which had troubled the
yeoman&rsquo;s mind ever since his horse-play on Anne at the
house on the down.&nbsp; To march into the mill and propose to
Mrs. Loveday for Anne before John&rsquo;s interest could revive
in her was, to this hero&rsquo;s thinking, excellent
discretion.</p>
<p>The day had already begun to darken when he entered, and the
cheerful fire shone red upon the floor and walls.&nbsp; Mrs.
Loveday received him alone, and asked him to take a seat by the
chimney-corner, a little of the old hankering for him as a
son-in-law having permanently remained with her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your servant, Mrs. Loveday,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and
I will tell you at once what I come for.&nbsp; You will say that
I take time by the forelock when I inform you that it is to push
on my long-wished-for alliance wi&rsquo; your daughter, as I
believe she is now a free woman again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Mr. Derriman,&rsquo; said the mother
placably.&nbsp; &lsquo;But she is ill at present.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll mention it to her when she is better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ask her to alter her cruel, cruel resolves against me,
on the score of&mdash;of my consuming passion for her.&nbsp; In
short,&rsquo; continued Festus, dropping his parlour language in
his warmth, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell thee what, Dame Loveday, I
want the maid, and must have her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Loveday replied that that was very plain speaking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; But Bob has given her up.&nbsp;
He never meant to marry her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you, Mrs.
Loveday, what I have never told a soul before.&nbsp; I was
standing upon Budmouth Quay on that very day in last September
that Bob set sail, and I heard him say to his brother John that
he gave your daughter up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it was very unmannerly of him to trifle with her
so,&rsquo; said Mrs. Loveday warmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who did he give
her up to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Festus replied with hesitation, &lsquo;He gave her up to
John.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To John?&nbsp; How could he give her up to a man
already over head and ears in love with that actress
woman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O?&nbsp; You surprise me.&nbsp; Which actress is
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That Miss Johnson.&nbsp; Anne tells me that he loves
her hopelessly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Festus arose.&nbsp; Miss Johnson seemed suddenly to acquire
high value as a sweetheart at this announcement.&nbsp; He had
himself felt a nameless attractiveness in her, and John had done
likewise.&nbsp; John crossed his path in all possible ways.</p>
<p>Before the yeoman had replied somebody opened the door, and
the firelight shone upon the uniform of the person they
discussed.&nbsp; Festus nodded on recognizing him, wished Mrs.
Loveday good evening, and went out precipitately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So Bob told you he meant to break off with my Anne when
he went away?&rsquo; Mrs. Loveday remarked to the
trumpet-major.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish I had known of it
before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John appeared disturbed at the sudden charge.&nbsp; He
murmured that he could not deny it, and then hastily turned from
her and followed Derriman, whom he saw before him on the
bridge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Derriman!&rsquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>Festus started and looked round.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
trumpet-major,&rsquo; he said blandly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When will you have sense enough to mind your own
business, and not come here telling things you have heard by
sneaking behind people&rsquo;s backs?&rsquo; demanded John
hotly.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t learn in any other way, I
shall have to pull your ears again, as I did the other
day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>You</i> pull my ears?&nbsp; How can you tell that
lie, when you know &rsquo;twas somebody else pulled
&rsquo;em?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no.&nbsp; I pulled your ears, and thrashed you in
a mild way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll swear to it?&nbsp; Surely &rsquo;twas
another man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was in the parlour at the public-house; you were
almost in the dark.&rsquo;&nbsp; And John added a few details as
to the particular blows, which amounted to proof itself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I heartily ask your pardon for saying &rsquo;twas
a lie!&rsquo; cried Festus, advancing with extended hand and a
genial smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sure, if I had known
<i>&rsquo;twas</i> you, I wouldn&rsquo;t have insulted you by
denying it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was why you didn&rsquo;t challenge me,
then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was it!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t for the world have
hurt your nice sense of honour by letting &rsquo;ee go
unchallenged, if I had known!&nbsp; And now, you see,
unfortunately I can&rsquo;t mend the mistake.&nbsp; So long a
time has passed since it happened that the heat of my temper is
gone off.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t oblige &rsquo;ee, try how I
might, for I am not a man, trumpet-major, that can butcher in
cold blood&mdash;no, not I, nor you neither, from what I know of
&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; So, willy-nilly, we must fain let it pass,
eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must, I suppose,&rsquo; said John, smiling
grimly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who did you think I was, then, that night
when I boxed you all round?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t press me,&rsquo; replied the
yeoman.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t reveal; it would be disgracing
myself to show how very wide of the truth the mockery of wine was
able to lead my senses.&nbsp; We will let it be buried in eternal
mixens of forgetfulness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As you wish,&rsquo; said the trumpet-major
loftily.&nbsp; &lsquo;But if you ever <i>should</i> think you
knew it was me, why, you know where to find me?&rsquo;&nbsp; And
Loveday walked away.</p>
<p>The instant that he was gone Festus shook his fist at the
evening star, which happened to lie in the same direction as that
taken by the dragoon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now for my revenge!&nbsp; Duels?&nbsp; Lifelong
disgrace to me if ever I fight with a man of blood below my
own!&nbsp; There are other remedies for upper-class souls!. .
.&nbsp; Matilda&mdash;that&rsquo;s my way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Festus strode along till he reached the Hall, where
Cripplestraw appeared gazing at him from under the arch of the
porter&rsquo;s lodge.&nbsp; Derriman dashed open the
entrance-hurdle with such violence that the whole row of them
fell flat in the mud.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mercy, Maister Festus!&rsquo; said Cripplestraw.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; I says to myself when I see ye
a-coming, &ldquo;surely Maister Festus is fuming like that
because there&rsquo;s no chance of the enemy coming this year
after all.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cr-r-ripplestraw!&nbsp; I have been wounded to the
heart,&rsquo; replied Derriman, with a lurid brow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the man yet lives, and you wants yer horse-pistols
instantly?&nbsp; Certainly, Maister F---&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Cripplestraw, not my pistols, but my new-cut
clothes, my heavy gold seals, my silver-topped cane, and my
buckles that cost more money than he ever saw!&nbsp; Yes, I must
tell somebody, and I&rsquo;ll tell you, because there&rsquo;s no
other fool near.&nbsp; He loves her heart and soul.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s poor; she&rsquo;s tip-top genteel, and not rich.&nbsp;
I am rich, by comparison.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll court the pretty
play-actress, and win her before his eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Play-actress, Maister Derriman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I saw her this very day, met her by
accident, and spoke to her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s still in the
town&mdash;perhaps because of him.&nbsp; I can meet her at any
hour of the day&mdash;&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t mean to marry her;
not I.&nbsp; I will court her for my pastime, and to annoy
him.&nbsp; It will be all the more death to him that I
don&rsquo;t want her.&nbsp; Then perhaps he will say to me,
&ldquo;You have taken my one ewe lamb&rdquo;&mdash;meaning that I
am the king, and he&rsquo;s the poor man, as in the church verse;
and he&rsquo;ll beg for mercy when &rsquo;tis too
late&mdash;unless, meanwhile, I shall have tired of my new
toy.&nbsp; Saddle the horse, Cripplestraw, to-morrow at
ten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Full of this resolve to scourge John Loveday to the quick
through his passion for Miss Johnson, Festus came out booted and
spurred at the time appointed, and set off on his morning
ride.</p>
<p>Miss Johnson&rsquo;s theatrical engagement having long ago
terminated, she would have left the Royal watering-place with the
rest of the visitors had not matrimonial hopes detained her
there.&nbsp; These had nothing whatever to do with John Loveday,
as may be imagined, but with a stout, staid boat-builder in Cove
Row by the quay, who had shown much interest in her
impersonations.&nbsp; Unfortunately this substantial man had not
been quite so attentive since the end of the season as his
previous manner led her to expect; and it was a great pleasure to
the lady to see Mr. Derriman leaning over the harbour bridge with
his eyes fixed upon her as she came towards it after a stroll
past her elderly wooer&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Od take it, ma&rsquo;am, you didn&rsquo;t tell me when
I saw you last that the tooting man with the blue jacket and lace
was yours devoted?&rsquo; began Festus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who do you mean?&rsquo;&nbsp; In Matilda&rsquo;s
ever-changing emotional interests, John Loveday was a stale and
unprofitable personality.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, that trumpet-major man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O!&nbsp; What of him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come; he loves you, and you know it,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She knew, at any rate, how to take the current when it
served.&nbsp; So she glanced at Festus, folded her lips
meaningly, and nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come to cut him out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head, it being unsafe to speak till she knew a
little more of the subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; said Festus, reddening, &lsquo;do you mean
to say that you think of him seriously&mdash;you, who might look
so much higher?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Constant dropping will wear away a stone; and you
should only hear his pleading!&nbsp; His handsome face is
impressive, and his manners are&mdash;O, so genteel!&nbsp; I am
not rich; I am, in short, a poor lady of decayed family, who has
nothing to boast of but my blood and ancestors, and they
won&rsquo;t find a body in food and clothing!&mdash;I hold the
world but as the world, Derrimanio&mdash;a stage where every man
must play a part, and mine a sad one!&rsquo;&nbsp; She dropped
her eyes thoughtfully and sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will talk of this,&rsquo; said Festus, much
affected.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us walk to the Look-out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She made no objection, and said, as they turned that way,
&lsquo;Mr. Derriman, a long time ago I found something belonging
to you; but I have never yet remembered to return
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she drew from her bosom the paper which Anne
had dropped in the meadow when eluding the grasp of Festus on
that summer day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Zounds, I smell fresh meat!&rsquo; cried Festus when he
had looked it over.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis in my uncle&rsquo;s
writing, and &rsquo;tis what I heard him singing on the day the
French didn&rsquo;t come, and afterwards saw him marking in the
road.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis something he&rsquo;s got hid away.&nbsp;
Give me the paper, there&rsquo;s a dear; &rsquo;tis worth
sterling gold!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Halves, then?&rsquo; said Matilda tenderly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gad, yes&mdash;anything!&rsquo; replied Festus, blazing
into a smile, for she had looked up in her best new manner at the
possibility that he might be worth the winning.&nbsp; They went
up the steps to the summit of the cliff, and dwindled over it
against the sky.</p>
<h2>XXXVII.&nbsp; REACTION</h2>
<p>There was no letter from Bob, though December had passed, and
the new year was two weeks old.&nbsp; His movements were,
however, pretty accurately registered in the papers, which John
still brought, but which Anne no longer read.&nbsp; During the
second week in December the Victory sailed for Sheerness, and on
the 9th of the following January the public funeral of Lord
Nelson took place in St. Paul&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Then there came a meagre line addressed to the family in
general.&nbsp; Bob&rsquo;s new Portsmouth attachment was not
mentioned, but he told them he had been one of the
eight-and-forty seamen who walked two-and-two in the funeral
procession, and that Captain Hardy had borne the banner of
emblems on the same occasion.&nbsp; The crew was soon to be paid
off at Chatham, when he thought of returning to Portsmouth for a
few days to see a valued friend.&nbsp; After that he should come
home.</p>
<p>But the spring advanced without bringing him, and John watched
Anne Garland&rsquo;s desolation with augmenting desire to do
something towards consoling her.&nbsp; The old feelings, so
religiously held in check, were stimulated to rebelliousness,
though they did not show themselves in any direct manner as
yet.</p>
<p>The miller, in the meantime, who seldom interfered in such
matters, was observed to look meaningly at Anne and the
trumpet-major from day to day; and by-and-by he spoke privately
to John.</p>
<p>His words were short and to the point: Anne was very
melancholy; she had thought too much of Bob.&nbsp; Now
&rsquo;twas plain that they had lost him for many years to
come.&nbsp; Well; he had always felt that of the two he would
rather John married her.&nbsp; Now John might settle down there,
and succeed where Bob had failed.&nbsp; &lsquo;So if you could
get her, my sonny, to think less of him and more of thyself, it
would be a good thing for all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An inward excitement had risen in John; but he suppressed it
and said firmly&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fairness to Bob before everything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He hev forgot her, and there&rsquo;s an end
on&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s not forgot him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well; think it over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This discourse was the cause of his penning a letter to his
brother.&nbsp; He begged for a distinct statement whether, as
John at first supposed, Bob&rsquo;s verbal renunciation of Anne
on the quay had been only a momentary ebullition of friendship,
which it would be cruel to take literally; or whether, as seemed
now, it had passed from a hasty resolve to a standing purpose,
persevered in for his own pleasure, with not a care for the
result on poor Anne.</p>
<p>John waited anxiously for the answer, but no answer came; and
the silence seemed even more significant than a letter of
assurance could have been of his absolution from further support
to a claim which Bob himself had so clearly renounced.&nbsp; Thus
it happened that paternal pressure, brotherly indifference, and
his own released impulse operated in one delightful direction,
and the trumpet-major once more approached Anne as in the old
time.</p>
<p>But it was not till she had been left to herself for a full
five months, and the blue-bells and ragged-robins of the
following year were again making themselves common to the
rambling eye, that he directly addressed her.&nbsp; She was tying
up a group of tall flowering plants in the garden: she knew that
he was behind her, but she did not turn.&nbsp; She had subsided
into a placid dignity which enabled her when watched to perform
any little action with seeming composure&mdash;very different
from the flutter of her inexperienced days.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you never going to turn round?&rsquo; he at length
asked good-humouredly.</p>
<p>She then did turn, and looked at him for a moment without
speaking; a certain suspicion looming in her eyes, as if
suggested by his perceptible want of ease.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How like summer it is getting to feel, is it
not?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>John admitted that it was getting to feel like summer: and,
bending his gaze upon her with an earnestness which no longer
left any doubt of his subject, went on to ask&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you ever in these last weeks thought of how it
used to be between us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She replied quickly, &lsquo;O, John, you shouldn&rsquo;t begin
that again.&nbsp; I am almost another woman now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all the more reason why I should,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne looked thoughtfully to the other end of the garden,
faintly shaking her head; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see it like
that,&rsquo; she returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You feel yourself quite free, don&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Quite</i> free!&rsquo; she said instantly, and with
proud distinctness; her eyes fell, and she repeated more slowly,
&lsquo;Quite free.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then her thoughts seemed to fly
from herself to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you are not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Johnson!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;that woman!&nbsp; You know as well as I that
was all make-up, and that I never for a moment thought of
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had an idea you were acting; but I wasn&rsquo;t
sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s nothing now.&nbsp; Anne, I want to
relieve your life; to cheer you in some way; to make some amends
for my brother&rsquo;s bad conduct.&nbsp; If you cannot love me,
liking will be well enough.&nbsp; I have thought over every side
of it so many times&mdash;for months have I been thinking it
over&mdash;and I am at last sure that I do right to put it to you
in this way.&nbsp; That I don&rsquo;t wrong Bob I am quite
convinced.&nbsp; As far as he is concerned we be both free.&nbsp;
Had I not been sure of that I would never have spoken.&nbsp;
Father wants me to take on the mill, and it will please him if
you can give me one little hope; it will make the house go on
altogether better if you can think o&rsquo; me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are generous and good, John,&rsquo; she said, as a
big round tear bowled helter-skelter down her face and
hat-strings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not that; I fear I am quite the opposite,&rsquo;
he said, without looking at her.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be all
gain to me&mdash;&nbsp; But you have not answered my
question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;John, I cannot!&rsquo; she
said, with a cheerless smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Positively I
cannot.&nbsp; Will you make me a promise?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want you to promise first&mdash;&nbsp; Yes, it is
dreadfully unreasonable,&rsquo; she added, in a mild
distress.&nbsp; &lsquo;But do promise!&rsquo;</p>
<p>John by this time seemed to have a feeling that it was all up
with him for the present.&nbsp; &lsquo;I promise,&rsquo; he said
listlessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is that you won&rsquo;t speak to me about this for
<i>ever</i> so long,&rsquo; she returned, with emphatic
kindliness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;very good.&nbsp;
Dear Anne, you don&rsquo;t think I have been unmanly or unfair in
starting this anew?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne looked into his face without a smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have been perfectly natural,&rsquo; she murmured.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And so I think have I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John, mournfully: &lsquo;You will not avoid me for this, or be
afraid of me?&nbsp; I will not break my word.&nbsp; I will not
worry you any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, John.&nbsp; You need not have said worry; it
isn&rsquo;t that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am very blind and stupid.&nbsp; I have been
hurting your heart all the time without knowing it.&nbsp; It is
my fate, I suppose.&nbsp; Men who love women the very best always
blunder and give more pain than those who love them
less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne laid one of her hands on the other as she softly replied,
looking down at them, &lsquo;No one loves me as well as you,
John; nobody in the world is so worthy to be loved; and yet I
cannot anyhow love you rightly.&rsquo;&nbsp; And lifting her
eyes, &lsquo;But I do so feel for you that I will try as hard as
I can to think about you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that is something,&rsquo; he said, smiling.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You say I must not speak about it again for ever so long;
how long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now that&rsquo;s not fair,&rsquo; Anne retorted, going
down the garden, and leaving him alone.</p>
<p>About a week passed.&nbsp; Then one afternoon the miller
walked up to Anne indoors, a weighty topic being expressed in his
tread.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was so glad, my honey,&rsquo; he began, with a
knowing smile, &lsquo;to see that from the mill-window last
week.&rsquo;&nbsp; He flung a nod in the direction of the
garden.</p>
<p>Anne innocently inquired what it could be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack and you in the garden together,&rsquo; he
continued laying his hand gently on her shoulder and stroking
it.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would so please me, my dear little girl, if
you could get to like him better than that weathercock, Master
Bob.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne shook her head; not in forcible negation, but to imply a
kind of neutrality.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Come now,&rsquo; said the
miller.</p>
<p>She threw back her head with a little laugh of
grievance.&nbsp; &lsquo;How you all beset me!&rsquo; she
expostulated.&nbsp; &lsquo;It makes me feel very wicked in not
obeying you, and being faithful&mdash;faithful
to&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; But she could not trust that side of the
subject to words.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why would it please you so
much?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;John is as steady and staunch a fellow as ever blowed a
trumpet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always thought you might do better with
him than with Bob.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ve a plan for taking him
into the mill, and letting him have a comfortable time o&rsquo;t
after his long knocking about; but so much depends upon you that
I must bide a bit till I see what your pleasure is about the poor
fellow.&nbsp; Mind, my dear, I don&rsquo;t want to force ye; I
only just ask ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne meditatively regarded the miller from under her shady
eyelids, the fingers of one hand playing a silent tattoo on her
bosom.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say to you,&rsquo;
she answered brusquely, and went away.</p>
<p>But these discourses were not without their effect upon the
extremely conscientious mind of Anne.&nbsp; They were, moreover,
much helped by an incident which took place one evening in the
autumn of this year, when John came to tea.&nbsp; Anne was
sitting on a low stool in front of the fire, her hands clasped
across her knee.&nbsp; John Loveday had just seated himself on a
chair close behind her, and Mrs. Loveday was in the act of
filling the teapot from the kettle which hung in the chimney
exactly above Anne.&nbsp; The kettle slipped forward suddenly,
whereupon John jumped from the chair and put his own two hands
over Anne&rsquo;s just in time to shield them, and the precious
knee she clasped, from the jet of scalding water which had
directed itself upon that point.&nbsp; The accidental overflow
was instantly checked by Mrs. Loveday; but what had come was
received by the devoted trumpet-major on the back of his
hands.</p>
<p>Anne, who had hardly been aware that he was behind her,
started up like a person awakened from a trance.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What have you done to yourself, poor John, to keep it off
me!&rsquo; she cried, looking at his hands.</p>
<p>John reddened emotionally at her words, &lsquo;It is a bit of
a scald, that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; he replied, drawing a finger
across the back of one hand, and bringing off the skin by the
touch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are scalded painfully, and I not at
all!&rsquo;&nbsp; She gazed into his kind face as she had never
gazed there before, and when Mrs. Loveday came back with oil and
other liniments for the wound Anne would let nobody dress it but
herself.&nbsp; It seemed as if her coyness had all gone, and when
she had done all that lay in her power she still sat by
him.&nbsp; At his departure she said what she had never said to
him in her life before: &lsquo;Come again soon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In short, that impulsive act of devotion, the last of a series
of the same tenor, had been the added drop which finally turned
the wheel.&nbsp; John&rsquo;s character deeply impressed
her.&nbsp; His determined steadfastness to his lode star won her
admiration, the more especially as that star was herself.&nbsp;
She began to wonder more and more how she could have so
persistently held out against his advances before Bob came home
to renew girlish memories which had by that time got considerably
weakened.&nbsp; Could she not, after all, please the miller, and
try to listen to John?&nbsp; By so doing she would make a worthy
man happy, the only sacrifice being at worst that of her unworthy
self, whose future was no longer valuable.&nbsp; &lsquo;As for
Bob, the woman is to be pitied who loves him,&rsquo; she
reflected indignantly, and persuaded herself that, whoever the
woman might be, she was not Anne Garland.</p>
<p>After this there was something of recklessness and something
of pleasantry in the young girl&rsquo;s manner of making herself
an example of the triumph of pride and common sense over memory
and sentiment.&nbsp; Her attitude had been epitomized in her
defiant singing at the time she learnt that Bob was not leal and
true.&nbsp; John, as was inevitable, came again almost
immediately, drawn thither by the sun of her first smile on him,
and the words which had accompanied it.&nbsp; And now instead of
going off to her little pursuits upstairs, downstairs, across the
room, in the corner, or to any place except where he happened to
be, as had been her custom hitherto, she remained seated near
him, returning interesting answers to his general remarks, and at
every opportunity letting him know that at last he had found
favour in her eyes.</p>
<p>The day was fine, and they went out of doors, where Anne
endeavoured to seat herself on the sloping stone of the
window-sill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How good you have become lately,&rsquo; said John,
standing over her and smiling in the sunlight which blazed
against the wall.&nbsp; &lsquo;I fancy you have stayed at home
this afternoon on my account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I have,&rsquo; she said gaily&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Do whatever we may for him, dame, we
cannot do too much!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he&rsquo;s one that has guarded our
land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;And he has done more than that: he has saved me from a
dreadful scalding.&nbsp; The back of your hand will not be well
for a long time, John, will it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He held out his hand to regard its condition, and the next
natural thing was to take hers.&nbsp; There was a glow upon his
face when he did it: his star was at last on a fair way towards
the zenith after its long and weary declination.&nbsp; The least
penetrating eye could have perceived that Anne had resolved to
let him woo, possibly in her temerity to let him win.&nbsp;
Whatever silent sorrow might be locked up in her, it was by this
time thrust a long way down from the light.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want you to go somewhere with me if you will,&rsquo;
he said, still holding her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes?&nbsp; Where is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a distant hill-side which, hitherto green, had
within the last few days begun to show scratches of white on its
face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Up there,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see little figures of men moving about.&nbsp; What
are they doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cutting out a huge picture of the king on horseback in
the earth of the hill.&nbsp; The king&rsquo;s head is to be as
big as our mill-pond and his body as big as this garden; he and
the horse will cover more than an acre.&nbsp; When shall we
go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whenever you please,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;John!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Loveday from the front
door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a friend come for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John went round, and found his trusty lieutenant, Trumpeter
Buck, waiting for him.&nbsp; A letter had come to the barracks
for John in his absence, and the trumpeter, who was going for a
walk, had brought it along with him.&nbsp; Buck then entered the
mill to discuss, if possible, a mug of last year&rsquo;s mead
with the miller; and John proceeded to read his letter, Anne
being still round the corner where he had left her.&nbsp; When he
had read a few words he turned as pale as a sheet, but he did not
move, and perused the writing to the end.</p>
<p>Afterwards he laid his elbow against the wall, and put his
palm to his head, thinking with painful intentness.&nbsp; Then he
took himself vigorously in hand, as it were, and gradually became
natural again.&nbsp; When he parted from Anne to go home with
Buck she noticed nothing different in him.</p>
<p>In barracks that evening he read the letter again.&nbsp; It
was from Bob; and the agitating contents were these:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
John</span>,&mdash;I have drifted off from writing till the
present time because I have not been clear about my feelings; but
I have discovered them at last, and can say beyond doubt that I
mean to be faithful to my dearest Anne after all.&nbsp; The fact
is, John, I&rsquo;ve got into a bit of a scrape, and I&rsquo;ve a
secret to tell you about it (which must go no further on any
account).&nbsp; On landing last autumn I fell in with a young
woman, and we got rather warm as folks do; in short, we liked one
another well enough for a while.&nbsp; But I have got into shoal
water with her, and have found her to be a terrible
take-in.&nbsp; Nothing in her at all&mdash;no sense, no niceness,
all tantrums and empty noise, John, though she seemed monstrous
clever at first.&nbsp; So my heart comes back to its old
anchorage.&nbsp; I hope my return to faithfulness will make no
difference to you.&nbsp; But as you showed by your looks at our
parting that you should not accept my offer to give her
up&mdash;made in too much haste, as I have since found&mdash;I
feel that you won&rsquo;t mind that I have returned to the path
of honour.&nbsp; I dare not write to Anne as yet, and please do
not let her know a word about the other young woman, or there
will be the devil to pay.&nbsp; I shall come home and make all
things right, please God.&nbsp; In the meantime I should take it
as a kindness, John, if you would keep a brotherly eye upon Anne,
and guide her mind back to me.&nbsp; I shall die of sorrow if
anybody sets her against me, for my hopes are getting bound up in
her again quite strong.&nbsp; Hoping you are jovial, as times go,
I am,&mdash;Your affectionate brother,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Robert</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the cold daylight fell upon John&rsquo;s face, as he
dressed himself next morning, the incipient yesterday&rsquo;s
wrinkle in his forehead had become permanently graven
there.&nbsp; He had resolved, for the sake of that only brother
whom he had nursed as a baby, instructed as a child, and
protected and loved always, to pause in his procedure for the
present, and at least do nothing to hinder Bob&rsquo;s
restoration to favour, if a genuine, even though temporarily
smothered, love for Anne should still hold possession of
him.&nbsp; But having arranged to take her to see the excavated
figure of the king, he started for Overcombe during the day, as
if nothing had occurred to check the smooth course of his
love.</p>
<h2>XXXVIII.&nbsp; A DELICATE SITUATION</h2>
<p>&lsquo;I am ready to go,&rsquo; said Anne, as soon as he
arrived.</p>
<p>He paused as if taken aback by her readiness, and replied with
much uncertainty, &lsquo;Would it&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t it be
better to put it off till there is less sun?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The very slightest symptom of surprise arose in her as she
rejoined, &lsquo;But the weather may change; or had we better not
go at all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no!&mdash;it was only a thought.&nbsp; We will start
at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And along the vale they went, John keeping himself about a
yard from her right hand.&nbsp; When the third field had been
crossed they came upon half-a-dozen little boys at play.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t he clasp her to his side, like a
man?&rsquo; said the biggest and rudest boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t he clasp her to his side, like a
man?&rsquo; echoed all the rude smaller boys in a chorus.</p>
<p>The trumpet-major turned, and, after some running, succeeded
in smacking two of them with his switch, returning to Anne
breathless.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am ashamed they should have insulted
you so,&rsquo; he said, blushing for her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They said no harm, poor boys,&rsquo; she replied
reproachfully.</p>
<p>Poor John was dumb with perception.&nbsp; The gentle hint upon
which he would have eagerly spoken only one short day ago was now
like fire to his wound.</p>
<p>They presently came to some stepping-stones across a
brook.&nbsp; John crossed first without turning his head, and
Anne, just lifting the skirt of her dress, crossed behind
him.&nbsp; When they had reached the other side a village girl
and a young shepherd approached the brink to cross.&nbsp; Anne
stopped and watched them.&nbsp; The shepherd took a hand of the
young girl in each of his own, and walked backward over the
stones, facing her, and keeping her upright by his grasp, both of
them laughing as they went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you staying for, Miss Garland?&rsquo; asked
John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was only thinking how happy they are,&rsquo; she said
quietly; and withdrawing her eyes from the tender pair, she
turned and followed him, not knowing that the seeming sound of a
passing bumble-bee was a suppressed groan from John.</p>
<p>When they reached the hill they found forty navvies at work
removing the dark sod so as to lay bare the chalk beneath.&nbsp;
The equestrian figure that their shovels were forming was
scarcely intelligible to John and Anne now they were close, and
after pacing from the horse&rsquo;s head down his breast to his
hoof, back by way of the king&rsquo;s bridle-arm, past the bridge
of his nose, and into his cocked-hat, Anne said that she had had
enough of it, and stepped out of the chalk clearing upon the
grass.&nbsp; The trumpet-major had remained all the time in a
melancholy attitude within the rowel of his Majesty&rsquo;s right
spur.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My shoes are caked with chalk,&rsquo; she said as they
walked downwards again; and she drew back her dress to look at
them.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can I get some of it cleared
off?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you was to wipe them in the long grass there,&rsquo;
said John, pointing to a spot where the blades were rank and
dense, &lsquo;some of it would come off.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having said
this, he walked on with religious firmness.</p>
<p>Anne raked her little feet on the right side, on the left
side, over the toe, and behind the heel; but the tenacious chalk
held its own.&nbsp; Panting with her exertion, she gave it up,
and at length overtook him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it is right now?&rsquo; he said, looking
gingerly over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed!&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wanted some
assistance&mdash;some one to steady me.&nbsp; It is so hard to
stand on one foot and wipe the other without support.&nbsp; I was
in danger of toppling over, and so gave it up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Merciful stars, what an opportunity!&rsquo; thought the
poor fellow while she waited for him to offer help. But his lips
remained closed, and she went on with a pouting smile&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem in such a hurry!&nbsp; Why are you in such a
hurry?&nbsp; After all the fine things you have said
about&mdash;about caring so much for me, and all that, you
won&rsquo;t stop for anything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was too much for John.&nbsp; &lsquo;Upon my heart and life,
my dea&mdash;&rsquo; he began.&nbsp; Here Bob&rsquo;s letter
crackled warningly in his waistcoat pocket as he laid his hand
asseveratingly upon his breast, and he became suddenly scaled up
to dumbness and gloom as before.</p>
<p>When they reached home Anne sank upon a stool outside the
door, fatigued with her excursion.&nbsp; Her first act was to try
to pull off her shoe&mdash;it was a difficult matter; but John
stood beating with his switch the leaves of the creeper on the
wall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother&mdash;David&mdash;Molly, or somebody&mdash;do
come and help me pull off these dirty shoes!&rsquo; she cried
aloud at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nobody helps me in
anything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry,&rsquo; said John, coming towards her
with incredible slowness and an air of unutterable
depression.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I can do without <i>you</i>.&nbsp; David is
best,&rsquo; she returned, as the old man approached and removed
the obnoxious shoes in a trice.</p>
<p>Anne was amazed at this sudden change from devotion to crass
indifference.&nbsp; On entering her room she flew to the glass,
almost expecting to learn that some extraordinary change had come
over her pretty countenance, rendering her intolerable for
evermore.&nbsp; But it was, if anything, fresher than usual, on
account of the exercise.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; she said
retrospectively.&nbsp; For the first time since their acqaintance
she had this week encouraged him; and for the first time he had
shown that encouragement was useless.&nbsp; &lsquo;But perhaps he
does not clearly understand,&rsquo; she added serenely.</p>
<p>When he next came it was, to her surprise, to bring her
newspapers, now for some time discontinued.&nbsp; As soon as she
saw them she said, &lsquo;I do not care for
newspapers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The shipping news is very full and long to-day, though
the print is rather small.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I take no further interest in the shipping news,&rsquo;
she replied with cold dignity.</p>
<p>She was sitting by the window, inside the table, and hence
when, in spite of her negations, he deliberately unfolded the
paper and began to read about the Royal Navy she could hardly
rise and go away.&nbsp; With a stoical mien he read on to the end
of the report, bringing out the name of Bob&rsquo;s ship with
tremendous force.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said at last, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll hear no
more!&nbsp; Let me read to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The trumpet-major sat down.&nbsp; Anne turned to the military
news, delivering every detail with much apparent
enthusiasm.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the subject <i>I</i>
like!&rsquo; she said fervently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;but Bob is in the navy now, and will most
likely rise to be an officer.&nbsp; And then&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is there like the army?&rsquo; she
interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no smartness about
sailors.&nbsp; They waddle like ducks, and they only fight stupid
battles that no one can form any idea of.&nbsp; There is no
science nor stratagem in sea-fights&mdash;nothing more than what
you see when two rams run their heads together in a field to
knock each other down.&nbsp; But in military battles there is
such art, and such splendour, and the men are so smart,
particularly the horse-soldiers.&nbsp; O, I shall never forget
what gallant men you all seemed when you came and pitched your
tents on the downs!&nbsp; I like the cavalry better than anything
I know; and the dragoons the best of the cavalry&mdash;and the
trumpeters the best of the dragoons!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, if it had but come a little sooner!&rsquo; moaned
John within him.&nbsp; He replied as soon as he could regain
self-command, &lsquo;I am glad Bob is in the navy at
last&mdash;he is so much more fitted for that than the
merchant-service&mdash;so brave by nature, ready for any daring
deed.&nbsp; I have heard ever so much more about his doings on
board the Victory.&nbsp; Captain Hardy took special notice that
when he&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know anything more about
it,&rsquo; said Anne impatiently; &lsquo;of course sailors fight;
there&rsquo;s nothing else to do in a ship, since you can&rsquo;t
run away!&nbsp; You may as well fight and be killed as be killed
not fighting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still it is his character to be careless of himself
where the honour of his country is concerned,&rsquo; John
pleaded.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you had only known him as a boy you
would own it.&nbsp; He would always risk his own life to save
anybody else&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Once when a cottage was afire up the
lane he rushed in for a baby, although he was only a boy himself,
and he had the narrowest escape.&nbsp; We have got his hat now
with the hole burnt in it.&nbsp; Shall I get it and show it to
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t wish it.&nbsp; It has nothing to
do with me.&rsquo;&nbsp; But as he persisted in his course
towards the door, she added, &lsquo;Ah! you are leaving because I
am in your way.&nbsp; You want to be alone while you read the
paper&mdash;I will go at once.&nbsp; I did not see that I was
interrupting you.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she rose as if to retreat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&nbsp; I would rather be interrupted by
<i>you</i> than&mdash;O, Miss Garland, excuse me!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll just speak to father in the mill, now I am
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to state that Anne (whose
unquestionable gentility amid somewhat homely surroundings has
been many times insisted on in the course of this history) was
usually the reverse of a woman with a coming-on disposition; but,
whether from pique at his manner, or from wilful adherence to a
course rashly resolved on, or from coquettish maliciousness in
reaction from long depression, or from any other thing,&mdash;so
it was that she would not let him go.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trumpet-major,&rsquo; she said, recalling him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; he replied timidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bow of my cap-ribbon has come untied, has it
not?&rsquo;&nbsp; She turned and fixed her bewitching glance upon
him.</p>
<p>The bow was just over her forehead, or, more precisely, at the
point where the organ of comparison merges in that of
benevolence, according to the phrenological theory of Gall.&nbsp;
John, thus brought to, endeavoured to look at the bow in a
skimming, duck-and-drake fashion, so as to avoid dipping his own
glance as far as to the plane of his interrogator&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is untied,&rsquo; he said, drawing back a
little.</p>
<p>She came nearer, and asked, &lsquo;Will you tie it for me,
please?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As there was no help for it, he nerved himself and
assented.&nbsp; As her head only reached to his fourth button she
necessarily looked up for his convenience, and John began
fumbling at the bow.&nbsp; Try as he would it was impossible to
touch the ribbon without getting his finger tips mixed with the
curls of her forehead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your hand shakes&mdash;ah! you have been walking
fast,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you almost done it?&rsquo;&nbsp; She inquiringly
directed her gaze upward through his fingers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;not yet,&rsquo; he faltered in a warm sweat of
emotion, his heart going like a flail.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then be quick, please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I will, Miss Garland!&nbsp; B-B-Bob is a very good
fel&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that man&rsquo;s name to me!&rsquo; she
interrupted.</p>
<p>John was silent instantly, and nothing was to be heard but the
rustling of the ribbon; till his hands once more blundered among
the curls, and then touched her forehead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O good God!&rsquo; ejaculated the trumpet-major in a
whisper, turning away hastily to the corner-cupboard, and resting
his face upon his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, John?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tie your cap-ribbon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you are so&mdash;Because I am clumsy, and never
could tie a bow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are clumsy indeed,&rsquo; answered Anne, and went
away.</p>
<p>After this she felt injured, for it seemed to show that he
rated her happiness as of meaner value than Bob&rsquo;s; since he
had persisted in his idea of giving Bob another chance when she
had implied that it was her wish to do otherwise.&nbsp; Could
Miss Johnson have anything to do with his firmness?&nbsp; An
opportunity of testing him in this direction occurred some days
later.&nbsp; She had been up the village, and met John at the
mill-door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you heard the news?&nbsp; Matilda Johnson is going
to be married to young Derriman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne stood with her back to the sun, and as he faced her, his
features were searchingly exhibited.&nbsp; There was no change
whatever in them, unless it were that a certain light of interest
kindled by her question turned to complete and blank
indifference.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, as times go, it is not a bad
match for her,&rsquo; he said, with a phlegm which was hardly
that of a lover.</p>
<p>John on his part was beginning to find these temptations
almost more than he could bear.&nbsp; But being quartered so near
to his father&rsquo;s house it was unnatural not to visit him,
especially when at any moment the regiment might be ordered
abroad, and a separation of years ensue; and as long as he went
there he could not help seeing her.</p>
<p>The year changed from green to gold, and from gold to grey,
but little change came over the house of Loveday.&nbsp; During
the last twelve months Bob had been occasionally heard of as
upholding his country&rsquo;s honour in Denmark, the West Indies,
Gibraltar, Malta, and other places about the globe, till the
family received a short letter stating that he had arrived again
at Portsmouth.&nbsp; At Portsmouth Bob seemed disposed to remain,
for though some time elapsed without further intelligence, the
gallant seaman never appeared at Overcombe.&nbsp; Then on a
sudden John learnt that Bob&rsquo;s long-talked-of promotion for
signal services rendered was to be an accomplished fact.&nbsp;
The trumpet-major at once walked off to Overcombe, and reached
the village in the early afternoon.&nbsp; Not one of the family
was in the house at the moment, and John strolled onwards over
the hill towards Casterbridge, without much thought of direction
till, lifting his eyes, he beheld Anne Garland wandering about
with a little basket upon her arm.</p>
<p>At first John blushed with delight at the sweet vision; but,
recalled by his conscience, the blush of delight was at once
mangled and slain.&nbsp; He looked for a means of retreat.&nbsp;
But the field was open, and a soldier was a conspicuous object:
there was no escaping her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was kind of you to come,&rsquo; she said, with an
inviting smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was quite by accident,&rsquo; he answered, with an
indifferent laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought you was at
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne blushed and said nothing, and they rambled on
together.&nbsp; In the middle of the field rose a fragment of
stone wall in the form of a gable, known as Faringdon Ruin; and
when they had reached it John paused and politely asked her if
she were not a little tired with walking so far.&nbsp; No
particular reply was returned by the young lady, but they both
stopped, and Anne seated herself on a stone, which had fallen
from the ruin to the ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A church once stood here,&rsquo; observed John in a
matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I have often shaped it out in my mind,&rsquo; she
returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here where I sit must have been the
altar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True; this standing bit of wall was the chancel
end.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne had been adding up her little studies of the
trumpet-major&rsquo;s character, and was surprised to find how
the brightness of that character increased in her eyes with each
examination.&nbsp; A kindly and gentle sensation was again
aroused in her.&nbsp; Here was a neglected heroic man, who,
loving her to distraction, deliberately doomed himself to pensive
shade to avoid even the appearance of standing in a
brother&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the altar stood here, hundreds of people have been
made man and wife just there, in past times,&rsquo; she said,
with calm deliberateness, throwing a little stone on a spot about
a yard westward.</p>
<p>John annihilated another tender burst and replied, &lsquo;Yes,
this field used to be a village.&nbsp; My grandfather could call
to mind when there were houses here.&nbsp; But the squire pulled
&rsquo;em down, because poor folk were an eyesore to
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know, John, what you once asked me to do?&rsquo;
she continued, not accepting the digression, and turning her eyes
upon him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In what sort of way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the matter of my future life, and yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;John Loveday!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned his back upon her for a moment, that she might not
see his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah&mdash;I do remember,&rsquo; he said
at last, in a dry, small, repressed voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;need I say more?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it
sufficient?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be sufficient,&rsquo; answered the unhappy
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;But&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked up with a reproachful smile, and shook her
head.&nbsp; &lsquo;That summer,&rsquo; she went on, &lsquo;you
asked me ten times if you asked me once.&nbsp; I am older now;
much more of a woman, you know; and my opinion is changed about
some people; especially about one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Anne, Anne!&rsquo; he burst out as, racked between
honour and desire, he snatched up her hand.&nbsp; The next moment
it fell heavily to her lap.&nbsp; He had absolutely relinquished
it half-way to his lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been thinking lately,&rsquo; he said, with
preternaturally sudden calmness, &lsquo;that men of the military
profession ought not to m&mdash;ought to be like St. Paul, I
mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fie, John; pretending religion!&rsquo; she said
sternly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t that at all.&nbsp;
<i>It&rsquo;s Bob</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; cried the miserable trumpet-major.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have had a letter from him to-day.&rsquo; He pulled out
a sheet of paper from his breast.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
it!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s promoted&mdash;he&rsquo;s a lieutenant, and
appointed to a sloop that only cruises on our own coast, so that
he&rsquo;ll be at home on leave half his time&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
be a gentleman some day, and worthy of you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He threw the letter into her lap, and drew back to the other
side of the gable-wall.&nbsp; Anne jumped up from her seat, flung
away the letter without looking at it, and went hastily on.&nbsp;
John did not attempt to overtake her.&nbsp; Picking up the
letter, he followed in her wake at a distance of a hundred
yards.</p>
<p>But, though Anne had withdrawn from his presence thus
precipitately, she never thought more highly of him in her life
than she did five minutes afterwards, when the excitement of the
moment had passed.&nbsp; She saw it all quite clearly; and his
self-sacrifice impressed her so much that the effect was just the
reverse of what he had been aiming to produce.&nbsp; The more he
pleaded for Bob, the more her perverse generosity pleaded for
John.&nbsp; To-day the crisis had come&mdash;with what results
she had not foreseen.</p>
<p>As soon as the trumpet-major reached the nearest pen-and-ink
he flung himself into a seat and wrote wildly to Bob:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Robert</span>,&mdash;I write these few lines to let you know that
if you want Anne Garland you must come at once&mdash;you must
come instantly, and post-haste&mdash;<i>or she will be
gone</i>!&nbsp; Somebody else wants her, and she wants him!&nbsp;
It is your last chance, in the opinion of&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Your faithful brother and
well-wisher,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">John</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;P.S.&mdash;Glad to hear of your promotion.&nbsp; Tell
me the day and I&rsquo;ll meet the coach.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>XXXIX.&nbsp; BOB LOVEDAY STRUTS UP AND DOWN</h2>
<p>One night, about a week later, two men were walking in the
dark along the turnpike road towards Overcombe, one of them with
a bag in his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the taller of the two, the squareness
of whose shoulders signified that he wore epaulettes, &lsquo;now
you must do the best you can for yourself, Bob.&nbsp; I have done
all I can; but th&rsquo;hast thy work cut out, I can tell
thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have run such a risk for the
world,&rsquo; said the other, in a tone of ingenuous
contrition.&nbsp; &lsquo;But thou&rsquo;st see, Jack, I
didn&rsquo;t think there was any danger, knowing you was taking
care of her, and keeping my place warm for me.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t hurry myself, that&rsquo;s true; but, thinks I, if I
get this promotion I am promised I shall naturally have leave,
and then I&rsquo;ll go and see &rsquo;em all.&nbsp; Gad, I
shouldn&rsquo;t have been here now but for your
letter!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You little think what risks you&rsquo;ve run,&rsquo;
said his brother.&nbsp; &lsquo;However, try to make up for lost
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right.&nbsp; And whatever you do, Jack, don&rsquo;t
say a word about this other girl.&nbsp; Hang the girl!&mdash;I
was a great fool, I know; still, it is over now, and I am come to
my senses.&nbsp; I suppose Anne never caught a capful of wind
from that quarter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She knows all about it,&rsquo; said John seriously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Knows?&nbsp; By George, then, I&rsquo;m ruined!&rsquo;
said Bob, standing stock-still in the road as if he meant to
remain there all night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I meant by saying it would be a hard
battle for &rsquo;ee,&rsquo; returned John, with the same
quietness as before.</p>
<p>Bob sighed and moved on.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve
that woman!&rsquo; he cried passionately, thumping his three
upper ribs with his fist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve thought as much myself,&rsquo; observed
John, with a dryness which was almost bitter.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it
depends on how thou&rsquo;st behave in future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;John,&rsquo; said Bob, taking his brother&rsquo;s hand,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be a new man.&nbsp; I solemnly swear by that
eternal milestone staring at me there that I&rsquo;ll never look
at another woman with the thought of marrying her whilst that
darling is free&mdash;no, not if she be a mermaiden of
light!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lucky thing that I&rsquo;m slipped in
on the quarterdeck! it may help me with her&mdash;hey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may with her mother; I don&rsquo;t think it will
make much difference with Anne.&nbsp; Still, it is a good thing;
and I hope that some day you&rsquo;ll command a big
ship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bob shook his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Officers are scarce; but
I&rsquo;m afraid my luck won&rsquo;t carry me so far as
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she ever tell you that she mentioned your name to
the King?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The seaman stood still again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;How did such a thing as that happen, in
Heaven&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>John described in detail, and they walked on, lost in
conjecture.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered the house the returned officer of the
navy was welcomed with acclamation by his father and David, with
mild approval by Mrs. Loveday, and by Anne not at all&mdash;that
discreet maiden having carefully retired to her own room some
time earlier in the evening.&nbsp; Bob did not dare to ask for
her in any positive manner; he just inquired about her health,
and that was all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with thy face, my
son?&rsquo; said the miller, staring.&nbsp; &lsquo;David, show a
light here.&rsquo;&nbsp; And a candle was thrust against
Bob&rsquo;s cheek, where there appeared a jagged streak like the
geological remains of a lobster.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;that&rsquo;s where that rascally
Frenchman&rsquo;s grenade busted and hit me from the Redoubtable,
you know, as I told &rsquo;ee in my letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a word!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, didn&rsquo;t I tell &rsquo;ee?&nbsp; Ah, no; I
meant to, but I forgot it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And here&rsquo;s a sort of dint in yer forehead too;
what do that mean, my dear boy?&rsquo; said the miller, putting
his finger in a chasm in Bob&rsquo;s skull.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was done in the Indies.&nbsp; Yes, that was rather
a troublesome chop&mdash;a cutlass did it.&nbsp; I should have
told &rsquo;ee, but I found &rsquo;twould make my letter so long
that I put it off, and put it off; and at last thought it
wasn&rsquo;t worth while.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John soon rose to take his departure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all up with me and her, you see,&rsquo; said
Bob to him outside the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s not even
going to see me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait a little,&rsquo; said the trumpet-major.&nbsp; It
was easy enough on the night of the arrival, in the midst of
excitement, when blood was warm, for Anne to be resolute in her
avoidance of Bob Loveday.&nbsp; But in the morning determination
is apt to grow invertebrate; rules of pugnacity are less easily
acted up to, and a feeling of live and let live takes possession
of the gentle soul.&nbsp; Anne had not meant even to sit down to
the same breakfast-table with Bob; but when the rest were
assembled, and had got some way through the substantial repast
which was served at this hour in the miller&rsquo;s house, Anne
entered.&nbsp; She came silently as a phantom, her eyes cast
down, her cheeks pale.&nbsp; It was a good long walk from the
door to the table, and Bob made a full inspection of her as she
came up to a chair at the remotest corner, in the direct rays of
the morning light, where she dumbly sat herself down.</p>
<p>It was altogether different from how she had expected.&nbsp;
Here was she, who had done nothing, feeling all the
embarrassment; and Bob, who had done the wrong, feeling
apparently quite at ease.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll speak to Bob, won&rsquo;t you,
honey?&rsquo; said the miller after a silence.&nbsp; To meet Bob
like this after an absence seemed irregular in his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he wish me to,&rsquo; she replied, so addressing the
miller that no part, scrap, or outlying beam whatever of her
glance passed near the subject of her remark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a lieutenant, you know, dear,&rsquo; said
her mother on the same side; &lsquo;and he&rsquo;s been
dreadfully wounded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh?&rsquo; said Anne, turning a little towards the
false one; at which Bob felt it to be time for him to put in a
spoke for himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to see you,&rsquo; he said contritely;
&lsquo;and how do you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He extended his hand.&nbsp; She allowed him to take hers, but
only to the extent of a niggardly inch or so.&nbsp; At the same
moment she glanced up at him, when their eyes met, and hers were
again withdrawn.</p>
<p>The hitch between the two younger members of the household
tended to make the breakfast a dull one.&nbsp; Bob was so
depressed by her unforgiving manner that he could not throw that
sparkle into his stories which their substance naturally
required; and when the meal was over, and they went about their
different businesses, the pair resembled the two Dromios in
seldom or never being, thanks to Anne&rsquo;s subtle
contrivances, both in the same room at the same time.</p>
<p>This kind of performance repeated itself during several
days.&nbsp; At last, after dogging her hither and thither,
leaning with a wrinkled forehead against doorposts, taking an
oblique view into the room where she happened to be, picking up
worsted balls and getting no thanks, placing a splinter from the
Victory, several bullets from the Redoubtable, a strip of the
flag, and other interesting relics, carefully labelled, upon her
table, and hearing no more about them than if they had been
pebbles from the nearest brook, he hit upon a new plan.&nbsp; To
avoid him she frequently sat upstairs in a window overlooking the
garden.&nbsp; Lieutenant Loveday carefully dressed himself in a
new uniform, which he had caused to be sent some days before, to
dazzle admiring friends, but which he had never as yet put on in
public or mentioned to a soul.&nbsp; When arrayed he entered the
sunny garden, and there walked slowly up and down as he had seen
Nelson and Captain Hardy do on the quarter-deck; but keeping his
right shoulder, on which his one epaulette was fixed, as much
towards Anne&rsquo;s window as possible.</p>
<p>But she made no sign, though there was not the least question
that she saw him.&nbsp; At the end of half-an-hour he went in,
took off his clothes, and gave himself up to doubt and the best
tobacco.</p>
<p>He repeated the programme on the next afternoon, and on the
next, never saying a word within doors about his doings or his
notice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the results in Anne&rsquo;s chamber were not
uninteresting.&nbsp; She had been looking out on the first day,
and was duly amazed to see a naval officer in full uniform
promenading in the path.&nbsp; Finding it to be Bob, she left the
window with a sense that the scene was not for her; then, from
mere curiosity, peeped out from behind the curtain.&nbsp; Well,
he was a pretty spectacle, she admitted, relieved as his figure
was by a dense mass of sunny, close-trimmed hedge, over which
nasturtiums climbed in wild luxuriance; and if she could care for
him one bit, which she couldn&rsquo;t, his form would have been a
delightful study, surpassing in interest even its splendour on
the memorable day of their visit to the town theatre.&nbsp; She
called her mother; Mrs. Loveday came promptly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, it is nothing,&rsquo; said Anne indifferently;
&lsquo;only that Bob has got his uniform.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Loveday peeped out, and raised her hands with
delight.&nbsp; &lsquo;And he has not said a word to us about
it!&nbsp; What a lovely epaulette!&nbsp; I must call his
father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed.&nbsp; As I take no interest in him I shall
not let people come into my room to admire him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you called me,&rsquo; said her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was because I thought you liked fine clothes.&nbsp;
It is what I don&rsquo;t care for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this assertion she again looked out at Bob the
next afternoon when his footsteps rustled on the gravel, and
studied his appearance under all the varying angles of the
sunlight, as if fine clothes and uniforms were not altogether a
matter of indifference.&nbsp; He certainly was a splendid,
gentlemanly, and gallant sailor from end to end of him; but then,
what were a dashing presentment, a naval rank, and telling scars,
if a man was fickle-hearted?&nbsp; However, she peeped on till
the fourth day, and then she did not peep.&nbsp; The window was
open, she looked right out, and Bob knew that he had got a rise
to his bait at last.&nbsp; He touched his hat to her, keeping his
right shoulder forwards, and said, &lsquo;Good-day, Miss
Garland,&rsquo; with a smile.</p>
<p>Anne replied, &lsquo;Good-day,&rsquo; with funereal
seriousness; and the acquaintance thus revived led to the
interchange of a few words at supper-time, at which Mrs. Loveday
nodded with satisfaction.&nbsp; But Anne took especial care that
he should never meet her alone, and to insure this her ingenuity
was in constant exercise.&nbsp; There were so many nooks and
windings on the miller&rsquo;s rambling premises that she could
never be sure he would not turn up within a foot of her,
particularly as his thin shoes were almost noiseless.</p>
<p>One fine afternoon she accompanied Molly in search of
elderberries for making the family wine which was drunk by Mrs.
Loveday, Anne, and anybody who could not stand the rougher and
stronger liquors provided by the miller.&nbsp; After walking
rather a long distance over the down they came to a grassy
hollow, where elder-bushes in knots of twos and threes rose from
an uneven bank and hung their heads towards the south, black and
heavy with bunches of fruit.&nbsp; The charm of fruit-gathering
to girls is enhanced in the case of elderberries by the
inoffensive softness of the leaves, boughs, and bark, which makes
getting into the branches easy and pleasant to the most
indifferent climbers.&nbsp; Anne and Molly had soon gathered a
basketful, and sending the servant home with it, Anne remained in
the bush picking and throwing down bunch by bunch upon the
grass.&nbsp; She was so absorbed in her occupation of pulling the
twigs towards her, and the rustling of their leaves so filled her
ears, that it was a great surprise when, on turning her head, she
perceived a similar movement to her own among the boughs of the
adjoining bush.</p>
<p>At first she thought they were disturbed by being partly in
contact with the boughs of her bush; but in a moment Robert
Loveday&rsquo;s face peered from them, at a distance of about a
yard from her own.&nbsp; Anne uttered a little indignant
&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; recovered herself, and went on
plucking.&nbsp; Bob thereupon went on plucking likewise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am picking elderberries for your mother,&rsquo; said
the lieutenant at last, humbly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I happen to have come to the next bush to
yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I see; but not the reason why.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne was now in the westernmost branches of the bush, and Bob
had leant across into the eastern branches of his.&nbsp; In
gathering he swayed towards her, back again, forward again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg pardon,&rsquo; he said, when a further swing than
usual had taken him almost in contact with her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why do you do it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wind rocks the bough, and the bough rocks
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; She expressed by a look her opinion of this
statement in the face of the gentlest breeze; and Bob pursued:
&lsquo;I am afraid the berries will stain your pretty
hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wear gloves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a plan I should never have thought
of.&nbsp; Can I help you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are offended: that&rsquo;s what that
means.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then will you shake hands?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne hesitated; then slowly stretched out her hand, which he
took at once.&nbsp; &lsquo;That will do,&rsquo; she said, finding
that he did not relinquish it immediately.&nbsp; But as he still
held it, she pulled, the effect of which was to draw Bob&rsquo;s
swaying person, bough and all, towards her, and herself towards
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid to let go your hand,&rsquo; said that
officer, &lsquo;for if I do your spar will fly back, and you will
be thrown upon the deck with great violence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you to let me go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He accordingly did, and she flew back, but did not by any
means fall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It reminds me of the times when I used to be aloft
clinging to a yard not much bigger than this tree-stem, in the
mid-Atlantic, and thinking about you.&nbsp; I could see you in my
fancy as plain as I see you now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Me, or some other woman!&rsquo; retorted Anne
haughtily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; declared Bob, shaking the bush for emphasis,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll protest that I did not think of anybody but you
all the time we were dropping down channel, all the time we were
off Cadiz, all the time through battles and bombardments.&nbsp; I
seemed to see you in the smoke, and, thinks I, if I go to
Davy&rsquo;s locker, what will she do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t think that when you landed after
Trafalgar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, now,&rsquo; said the lieutenant in a reasoning
tone; &lsquo;that was a curious thing.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll hardly
believe it, maybe; but when a man is away from the woman he loves
best in the port&mdash;world, I mean&mdash;he can have a sort of
temporary feeling for another without disturbing the old one,
which flows along under the same as ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it, and won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said
Anne firmly.</p>
<p>Molly now appeared with the empty basket, and when it had been
filled from the heap on the grass, Anne went home with her,
bidding Loveday a frigid adieu.</p>
<p>The same evening, when Bob was absent, the miller proposed
that they should all three go to an upper window of the house, to
get a distant view of some rockets and illuminations which were
to be exhibited in the town and harbour in honour of the King,
who had returned this year as usual.&nbsp; They accordingly went
upstairs to an empty attic, placed chairs against the window, and
put out the light; Anne sitting in the middle, her mother close
by, and the miller behind, smoking.&nbsp; No sign of any
pyrotechnic display was visible over the port as yet, and Mrs.
Loveday passed the time by talking to the miller, who replied in
monosyllables.&nbsp; While this was going on Anne fancied that
she heard some one approach, and presently felt sure that Bob was
drawing near her in the surrounding darkness; but as the other
two had noticed nothing she said not a word.</p>
<p>All at once the swarthy expanse of southward sky was broken by
the blaze of several rockets simultaneously ascending from
different ships in the roads.&nbsp; At the very same moment a
warm mysterious hand slipped round her own, and gave it a gentle
squeeze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O dear!&rsquo; said Anne, with a sudden start away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How nervous you are, child, to be startled by fireworks
so far off,&rsquo; said Mrs. Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never saw rockets before,&rsquo; murmured Anne,
recovering from her surprise.</p>
<p>Mrs. Loveday presently spoke again.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wonder what
has become of Bob?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne did not reply, being much exercised in trying to get her
hand away from the one that imprisoned it; and whatever the
miller thought he kept to himself, because it disturbed his
smoking to speak.</p>
<p>Another batch of rockets went up.&nbsp; &lsquo;O I
never!&rsquo; said Anne, in a half-suppressed tone, springing in
her chair.&nbsp; A second hand had with the rise of the rockets
leapt round her waist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor girl, you certainly must have change of scene at
this rate,&rsquo; said Mrs. Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose I must,&rsquo; murmured the dutiful
daughter.</p>
<p>For some minutes nothing further occurred to disturb
Anne&rsquo;s serenity.&nbsp; Then a slow, quiet
&lsquo;a-hem&rsquo; came from the obscurity of the apartment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, Bob?&nbsp; How long have you been there?&rsquo;
inquired Mrs. Loveday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not long,&rsquo; said the lieutenant coolly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I heard you were all here, and crept up quietly, not to
disturb ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you wear heels to your shoes like
Christian people, and not creep about so like a cat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it keeps your floors clean to go
slip-shod.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Anne was gently but firmly trying to pull
Bob&rsquo;s arm from her waist, her distressful difficulty being
that in freeing her waist she enslaved her hand, and in getting
her hand free she enslaved her waist.&nbsp; Finding the struggle
a futile one, owing to the invisibility of her antagonist, and
her wish to keep its nature secret from the other two, she arose,
and saying that she did not care to see any more, felt her way
downstairs.&nbsp; Bob followed, leaving Loveday and his wife to
themselves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Anne,&rsquo; he began, when he had got down, and
saw her in the candle-light of the large room.&nbsp; But she
adroitly passed out at the other door, at which he took a candle
and followed her to the small room.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear Anne, do
let me speak,&rsquo; he repeated, as soon as the rays revealed
her figure.&nbsp; But she passed into the bakehouse before he
could say more; whereupon he perseveringly did the same.&nbsp;
Looking round for her here he perceived her at the end of the
room, where there were no means of exit whatever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Anne,&rsquo; he began again, setting down the
candle, &lsquo;you must try to forgive me; really you must.&nbsp;
I love you the best of anybody in the wide, wide world.&nbsp; Try
to forgive me; come!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he imploringly took her
hand.</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s bosom began to surge and fall like a small tide,
her eyes remaining fixed upon the floor; till, when Loveday
ventured to draw her slightly towards him, she burst out
crying.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like you, Bob; I
don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she suddenly exclaimed between her
sobs.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did once, but I don&rsquo;t now&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t; you have been very cruel to
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; She violently turned away, weeping.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have, I have been terribly bad, I know,&rsquo;
answered Bob, conscience-stricken by her grief.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But&mdash;if you could only forgive me&mdash;I promise
that I&rsquo;ll never do anything to grieve &rsquo;ee
again.&nbsp; Do you forgive me, Anne?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s only reply was crying and shaking her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s make it up.&nbsp; Come, say we have made it
up, dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She withdrew her hand, and still keeping her eyes buried in
her handkerchief, said &lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then!&rsquo; exclaimed Bob, with sudden
determination.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now I know my doom!&nbsp; And
whatever you hear of as happening to me, mind this, you cruel
girl, that it is all your causing!&rsquo;&nbsp; Saying this he
strode with a hasty tread across the room into the passage and
out at the door, slamming it loudly behind him.</p>
<p>Anne suddenly looked up from her handkerchief, and stared with
round wet eyes and parted lips at the door by which he had
gone.&nbsp; Having remained with suspended breath in this
attitude for a few seconds she turned round, bent her head upon
the table, and burst out weeping anew with thrice the violence of
the former time.&nbsp; It really seemed now as if her grief would
overwhelm her, all the emotions which had been suppressed,
bottled up, and concealed since Bob&rsquo;s return having made
themselves a sluice at last.</p>
<p>But such things have their end; and left to herself in the
large, vacant, old apartment, she grew quieter, and at last
calm.&nbsp; At length she took the candle and ascended to her
bedroom, where she bathed her eyes and looked in the glass to see
if she had made herself a dreadful object.&nbsp; It was not so
bad as she had expected, and she went downstairs again.</p>
<p>Nobody was there, and, sitting down, she wondered what Bob had
really meant by his words.&nbsp; It was too dreadful to think
that he intended to go straight away to sea without seeing her
again, and frightened at what she had done she waited anxiously
for his return.</p>
<h2>XL.&nbsp; A CALL ON BUSINESS</h2>
<p>Her suspense was interrupted by a very gentle tapping at the
door, and then the rustle of a hand over its surface, as if
searching for the latch in the dark.&nbsp; The door opened a few
inches, and the alabaster face of Uncle Benjy appeared in the
slit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Squire Derriman, you frighten me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All alone?&rsquo; he asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My mother and Mr. Loveday are somewhere about the
house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will do,&rsquo; he said, coming forward.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I be wherrited out of my life, and I have thought of you
again&mdash;you yourself, dear Anne, and not the miller.&nbsp; If
you will only take this and lock it up for a few days till I can
find another good place for it&mdash;if you only
would!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he breathlessly deposited the tin box on
the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, obliged to dig it up from the cellar?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay; my nephew hath a scent of the place&mdash;how, I
don&rsquo;t know! but he and a young woman he&rsquo;s met with
are searching everywhere.&nbsp; I worked like a wire-drawer to
get it up and away while they were scraping in the next
cellar.&nbsp; Now where could ye put it, dear?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
only a few documents, and my will, and such like, you know.&nbsp;
Poor soul o&rsquo; me, I&rsquo;m worn out with running and
fright!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put it here till I can think of a better
place,&rsquo; said Anne, lifting the box.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear me,
how heavy it is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said Uncle Benjy hastily; &lsquo;the
box is iron, you see.&nbsp; However, take care of it, because I
am going to make it worth your while.&nbsp; Ah, you are a good
girl, Anne.&nbsp; I wish you was mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne looked at Uncle Benjy.&nbsp; She had known for some time
that she possessed all the affection he had to bestow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you wish that?&rsquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t ye argue with me.&nbsp; Where
d&rsquo;ye put the coffer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said Anne, going to the window-seat, which
rose as a flap, disclosing a boxed receptacle beneath, as in many
old houses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis very well for the present,&rsquo; he said
dubiously, and they dropped the coffer in, Anne locking down the
seat, and giving him the key.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now I don&rsquo;t want
ye to be on my side for nothing,&rsquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I never did now, did I?&nbsp; This is for
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; He handed her a little packet of paper, which
Anne turned over and looked at curiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;I always
meant to do it,&rsquo; continued Uncle Benjy, gazing at the
packet as it lay in her hand, and sighing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come,
open it, my dear; I always meant to do it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She opened it and found twenty new guineas snugly packed
within.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, they are for you.&nbsp; I always meant to do
it!&rsquo; he said, sighing again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you owe me nothing!&rsquo; returned Anne, holding
them out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say it!&rsquo; cried Uncle Benjy, covering
his eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Put &rsquo;em away. . . .&nbsp; Well, if
you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> want &rsquo;em&mdash;But put &rsquo;em
away, dear Anne; they are for you, because you have kept my
counsel.&nbsp; Good-night t&rsquo;ye.&nbsp; Yes, they are for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went a few steps, and turning back added anxiously,
&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t spend &rsquo;em in clothes, or waste
&rsquo;em in fairings, or ornaments of any kind, my dear
girl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; said Anne.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish you
would have them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Uncle Benjy, rushing off to escape
their shine.&nbsp; But he had got no further than the passage
when he returned again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you won&rsquo;t lend &rsquo;em to anybody, or put
&rsquo;em into the bank&mdash;for no bank is safe in these
troublous times?. . .&nbsp; If I was you I&rsquo;d keep them
<i>exactly</i> as they be, and not spend &rsquo;em on any
account.&nbsp; Shall I lock them into my box for ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said she; and the farmer rapidly
unlocked the window-bench, opened the box, and locked them
in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis much the best plan,&rsquo; he said with
great satisfaction as he returned the keys to his pocket.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There they will always be safe, you see, and you
won&rsquo;t be exposed to temptation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the old man had been gone a few minutes, the miller and
his wife came in, quite unconscious of all that had passed.&nbsp;
Anne&rsquo;s anxiety about Bob was again uppermost now, and she
spoke but meagrely of old Derriman&rsquo;s visit, and nothing of
what he had left.&nbsp; She would fain have asked them if they
knew where Bob was, but that she did not wish to inform them of
the rupture.&nbsp; She was forced to admit to herself that she
had somewhat tried his patience, and that impulsive men had been
known to do dark things with themselves at such times.</p>
<p>They sat down to supper, the clock ticked rapidly on, and at
length the miller said, &lsquo;Bob is later than usual.&nbsp;
Where can he be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As they both looked at her, she could no longer keep the
secret.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is my fault,&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;I have driven
him away!&nbsp; What shall I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The nature of the quarrel was at once guessed, and her two
elders said no more.&nbsp; Anne rose and went to the front door,
where she listened for every sound with a palpitating
heart.&nbsp; Then she went in; then she went out: and on one
occasion she heard the miller say, &lsquo;I wonder what hath
passed between Bob and Anne.&nbsp; I hope the chap will come
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just about this time light footsteps were heard without, and
Bob bounced into the passage.&nbsp; Anne, who stood back in the
dark while he passed, followed him into the room, where her
mother and the miller were on the point of retiring to bed,
candle in hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have kept ye up, I fear,&rsquo; began Bob cheerily,
and apparently without the faintest recollection of his tragic
exit from the house.&nbsp; &lsquo;But the truth on&rsquo;t is, I
met with Fess Derriman at the &ldquo;Duke of York&rdquo; as I
went from here, and there we have been playing Put ever since,
not noticing how the time was going.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t had a
good chat with the fellow for years and years, and really he is
an out and out good comrade&mdash;a regular hearty!&nbsp; Poor
fellow, he&rsquo;s been very badly used.&nbsp; I never heard the
rights of the story till now; but it seems that old uncle of his
treats him shamefully.&nbsp; He has been hiding away his money,
so that poor Fess might not have a farthing, till at last the
young man has turned, like any other worm, and is now determined
to ferret out what he has done with it.&nbsp; The poor young chap
hadn&rsquo;t a farthing of ready money till I lent him a couple
of guineas&mdash;a thing I never did more willingly in my
life.&nbsp; But the man was very honourable.&nbsp; &ldquo;No;
no,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let me deprive
ye.&rdquo;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going to marry, and what may you
think he is going to do it for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For love, I hope,&rsquo; said Anne&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For money, I suppose, since he&rsquo;s so short,&rsquo;
said the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Bob, &lsquo;for <i>spite</i>.&nbsp; He
has been badly served&mdash;deuced badly served&mdash;by a
woman.&nbsp; I never heard of a more heartless case in my
life.&nbsp; The poor chap wouldn&rsquo;t mention names, but it
seems this young woman has trifled with him in all manner of
cruel ways&mdash;pushed him into the river, tried to steal his
horse when he was called out to defend his country&mdash;in
short, served him rascally.&nbsp; So I gave him the two guineas
and said, &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s drink to the hussy&rsquo;s
downfall!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O!&rsquo; said Anne, having approached behind him.</p>
<p>Bob turned and saw her, and at the same moment Mr. and Mrs.
Loveday discreetly retired by the other door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it peace?&rsquo; he asked tenderly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; she anxiously replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t mean to make you think I had no
heart.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this Bob inclined his countenance towards
hers.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said, smiling through two
incipient tears as she drew back.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are to show
good behaviour for six months, and you must promise not to
frighten me again by running off when I&mdash;show you how badly
you have served me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am yours obedient&mdash;in anything,&rsquo; cried
Bob.&nbsp; &lsquo;But am I pardoned?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Youth is foolish; and does a woman often let her reasoning in
favour of the worthier stand in the way of her perverse desire
for the less worthy at such times as these?&nbsp; She murmured
some soft words, ending with &lsquo;Do you repent?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It would be superfluous to transcribe Bob&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>Footsteps were heard without.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O begad; I forgot!&rsquo; said Bob.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s waiting out there for a light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friend Derriman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Bob, I have to explain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Festus had by this time entered the lobby, and Anne, with
a hasty &lsquo;Get rid of him at once!&rsquo; vanished
upstairs.</p>
<p>Here she waited and waited, but Festus did not seem inclined
to depart; and at last, foreboding some collision of interests
from Bob&rsquo;s new friendship for this man, she crept into a
storeroom which was over the apartment into which Loveday and
Festus had gone.&nbsp; By looking through a knot-hole in the
floor it was easy to command a view of the room beneath, this
being unceiled, with moulded beams and rafters.</p>
<p>Festus had sat down on the hollow window-bench, and was
continuing the statement of his wrongs.&nbsp; &lsquo;If he only
knew what he was sitting upon,&rsquo; she thought apprehensively,
&lsquo;how easily he could tear up the flap, lock and all, with
his strong arm, and seize upon poor Uncle Benjy&rsquo;s
possessions!&rsquo;&nbsp; But he did not appear to know, unless
he were acting, which was just possible.&nbsp; After a while he
rose, and going to the table lifted the candle to light his
pipe.&nbsp; At the moment when the flame began diving into the
bowl the door noiselessly opened and a figure slipped across the
room to the window-bench, hastily unlocked it, withdrew the box,
and beat a retreat.&nbsp; Anne in a moment recognized the ghostly
intruder as Festus Derriman&rsquo;s uncle.&nbsp; Before he could
get out of the room Festus set down the candle and turned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;Uncle Benjy&mdash;haw, haw!&nbsp; Here at
this time of night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Benjy&rsquo;s eyes grew paralyzed, and his mouth opened
and shut like a frog&rsquo;s in a drought, the action producing
no sound.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have we got here&mdash;a tin box&mdash;the box of
boxes?&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll carry it for &rsquo;ee,
uncle!&mdash;I am going home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;N-no-no, thanky, Festus: it is n-n-not heavy at all,
thanky,&rsquo; gasped the squireen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O but I must,&rsquo; said Festus, pulling at the
box.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let him have it, Bob!&rsquo; screamed the
excited Anne through the hole in the floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t let him!&rsquo; cried the uncle.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a plot&mdash;there&rsquo;s a woman at the
window waiting to help him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s eyes flew to the window, and she saw
Matilda&rsquo;s face pressed against the pane.</p>
<p>Bob, though he did not know whence Anne&rsquo;s command
proceeded obeyed with alacrity, pulled the box from the two
relatives, and placed it on the table beside him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, look here, hearties; what&rsquo;s the meaning
o&rsquo; this?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s trying to rob me of all I possess!&rsquo;
cried the old man.&nbsp; &lsquo;My heart-strings seem as if they
were going crack, crack, crack!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this instant the miller in his shirt-sleeves entered the
room, having got thus far in his undressing when he heard the
noise.&nbsp; Bob and Festus turned to him to explain; and when
the latter had had his say Bob added, &lsquo;Well, all I know is
that this box&rsquo;&mdash;here he stretched out his hand to lay
it upon the lid for emphasis.&nbsp; But as nothing but thin air
met his fingers where the box had been, he turned, and found that
the box was gone, Uncle Benjy having vanished also.</p>
<p>Festus, with an imprecation, hastened to the door, but though
the night was not dark Farmer Derriman and his burden were
nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; On the bridge Festus joined a shadowy
female form, and they went along the road together, followed for
some distance by Bob, lest they should meet with and harm the old
man.&nbsp; But the precaution was unnecessary: nowhere on the
road was there any sign of Farmer Derriman, or of the box that
belonged to him.&nbsp; When Bob re-entered the house Anne and
Mrs. Loveday had joined the miller downstairs, and then for the
first time he learnt who had been the heroine of Festus&rsquo;s
lamentable story, with many other particulars of that
yeoman&rsquo;s history which he had never before known.&nbsp; Bob
swore that he would not speak to the traitor again, and the
family retired.</p>
<p>The escape of old Mr. Derriman from the annoyances of his
nephew not only held good for that night, but for next day, and
for ever.&nbsp; Just after dawn on the following morning a
labouring man, who was going to his work, saw the old farmer and
landowner leaning over a rail in a mead near his house,
apparently engaged in contemplating the water of a brook before
him.&nbsp; Drawing near, the man spoke, but Uncle Benjy did not
reply.&nbsp; His head was hanging strangely, his body being
supported in its erect position entirely by the rail that passed
under each arm.&nbsp; On after-examination it was found that
Uncle Benjy&rsquo;s poor withered heart had cracked and stopped
its beating from damages inflicted on it by the excitements of
his life, and of the previous night in particular.&nbsp; The
unconscious carcass was little more than a light empty husk, dry
and fleshless as that of a dead heron found on a moor in
January.</p>
<p>But the tin box was not discovered with or near him.&nbsp; It
was searched for all the week, and all the month.&nbsp; The
mill-pond was dragged, quarries were examined, woods were
threaded, rewards were offered; but in vain.</p>
<p>At length one day in the spring, when the mill-house was about
to be cleaned throughout, the chimney-board of Anne&rsquo;s
bedroom, concealing a yawning fire-place, had to be taken
down.&nbsp; In the chasm behind it stood the missing deed-box of
Farmer Derriman.</p>
<p>Many were the conjectures as to how it had got there. Then
Anne remembered that on going to bed on the night of the
collision between Festus and his uncle in the room below, she had
seen mud on the carpet of her room, and the miller remembered
that he had seen footprints on the back staircase.&nbsp; The
solution of the mystery seemed to be that the late Uncle Benjy,
instead of running off from the house with his box, had doubled
on getting out of the front door, entered at the back, deposited
his box in Anne&rsquo;s chamber where it was found, and then
leisurely pursued his way home at the heels of Festus, intending
to tell Anne of his trick the next day&mdash;an intention that
was for ever frustrated by the stroke of death.</p>
<p>Mr. Derriman&rsquo;s solicitor was a Casterbridge man, and
Anne placed the box in his hands.&nbsp; Uncle Benjy&rsquo;s will
was discovered within; and by this testament Anne&rsquo;s queer
old friend appointed her sole executrix of his said will, and,
more than that, gave and bequeathed to the same young lady all
his real and personal estate, with the solitary exception of five
small freehold houses in a back street in Budmouth, which were
devised to his nephew Festus, as a sufficient property to
maintain him decently, without affording any margin for
extravagances.&nbsp; Oxwell Hall, with its muddy quadrangle,
archways, mullioned windows, cracked battlements, and weed-grown
garden, passed with the rest into the hands of Anne.</p>
<h2>XLI.&nbsp; JOHN MARCHES INTO THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>During this exciting time John Loveday seldom or never
appeared at the mill.&nbsp; With the recall of Bob, in which he
had been sole agent, his mission seemed to be complete.</p>
<p>One mid-day, before Anne had made any change in her manner of
living on account of her unexpected acquisition, Lieutenant Bob
came in rather suddenly.&nbsp; He had been to Budmouth, and
announced to the arrested senses of the family that the --th
Dragoons were ordered to join Sir Arthur Wellesley in the
Peninsula.</p>
<p>These tidings produced a great impression on the
household.&nbsp; John had been so long in the neighbourhood,
either at camp or in barracks, that they had almost forgotten the
possibility of his being sent away; and they now began to reflect
upon the singular infrequency of his calls since his
brother&rsquo;s return.&nbsp; There was not much time, however,
for reflection, if they wished to make the most of John&rsquo;s
farewell visit, which was to be paid the same evening, the
departure of the regiment being fixed for next day.&nbsp; A
hurried valedictory supper was prepared during the afternoon, and
shortly afterwards John arrived.</p>
<p>He seemed to be more thoughtful and a trifle paler than of
old, but beyond these traces, which might have been due to the
natural wear and tear of time, he showed no signs of gloom.&nbsp;
On his way through the town that morning a curious little
incident had occurred to him.&nbsp; He was walking past one of
the churches when a wedding-party came forth, the bride and
bridegroom being Matilda and Festus Derriman.&nbsp; At sight of
the trumpet-major the yeoman had glared triumphantly; Matilda, on
her part, had winked at him slily, as much as to
say&mdash;.&nbsp; But what she meant heaven knows: the
trumpet-major did not trouble himself to think, and passed on
without returning the mark of confidence with which she had
favoured him.</p>
<p>Soon after John&rsquo;s arrival at the mill several of his
friends dropped in for the same purpose of bidding adieu.&nbsp;
They were mostly the men who had been entertained there on the
occasion of the regiment&rsquo;s advent on the down, when Anne
and her mother were coaxed in to grace the party by their
superior presence; and their well-trained, gallant manners were
such as to make them interesting visitors now as at all
times.&nbsp; For it was a period when romance had not so greatly
faded out of military life as it has done in these days of short
service, heterogeneous mixing, and transient campaigns; when the
esprit de corps was strong, and long experience stamped
noteworthy professional characteristics even on rank and file;
while the miller&rsquo;s visitors had the additional advantage of
being picked men.</p>
<p>They could not stay so long to-night as on that earlier and
more cheerful occasion, and the final adieus were spoken at an
early hour.&nbsp; It was no mere playing at departure, as when
they had gone to Exonbury barracks, and there was a warm and
prolonged shaking of hands all round.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll wish the poor fellows good-bye?&rsquo;
said Bob to Anne, who had not come forward for that purpose like
the rest.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are going away, and would like to
have your good word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She then shyly advanced, and every man felt that he must make
some pretty speech as he shook her by the hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye!&nbsp; May you remember us as long as it makes
ye happy, and forget us as soon as it makes ye sad,&rsquo; said
Sergeant Brett.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-night!&nbsp; Health, wealth, and long life to
ye!&rsquo; said Sergeant-major Wills, taking her hand from
Brett.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust to meet ye again as the wife of a worthy
man,&rsquo; said Trumpeter Buck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll drink your health throughout the campaign,
and so good-bye t&rsquo;ye,&rsquo; said Saddler-sergeant Jones,
raising her hand to his lips.</p>
<p>Three others followed with similar remarks, to each of which
Anne blushingly replied as well as she could, wishing them a
prosperous voyage, easy conquest, and a speedy return.</p>
<p>But, alas, for that!&nbsp; Battles and skirmishes, advances
and retreats, fevers and fatigues, told hard on Anne&rsquo;s
gallant friends in the coming time.&nbsp; Of the seven upon whom
these wishes were bestowed, five, including the trumpet-major,
were dead men within the few following years, and their bones
left to moulder in the land of their campaigns.</p>
<p>John lingered behind.&nbsp; When the others were outside,
expressing a final farewell to his father, Bob, and Mrs. Loveday,
he came to Anne, who remained within.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I thought you were going to look in again before
leaving?&rsquo; she said gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I find I cannot.&nbsp; Good-bye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;John,&rsquo; said Anne, holding his right hand in both
hers, &lsquo;I must tell you something.&nbsp; You were wise in
not taking me at my word that day.&nbsp; I was greatly mistaken
about myself.&nbsp; Gratitude is not love, though I wanted to
make it so for the time.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t call me
thoughtless for what I did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Anne,&rsquo; cried John, with more gaiety than
truthfulness, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t let yourself be troubled!&nbsp;
What happens is for the best.&nbsp; Soldiers love here to-day and
there to-morrow.&nbsp; Who knows that you won&rsquo;t hear of my
attentions to some Spanish maid before a month is gone by?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis the way of us, you know; a soldier&rsquo;s heart is
not worth a week&rsquo;s purchase&mdash;ha, ha!&nbsp; Goodbye,
good-bye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne felt the expediency of his manner, received the
affectation as real, and smiled her reply, not knowing that the
adieu was for evermore.&nbsp; Then with a tear in his eye he went
out of the door, where he bade farewell to the miller, Mrs.
Loveday, and Bob, who said at parting, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all
right, Jack, my dear fellow.&nbsp; After a coaxing that would
have been enough to win three ordinary Englishwomen, five French,
and ten Mulotters, she has to-day agreed to bestow her hand upon
me at the end of six months.&nbsp; Good-bye, Jack,
good-bye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The candle held by his father shed its waving light upon
John&rsquo;s face and uniform as with a farewell smile he turned
on the doorstone, backed by the black night; and in another
moment he had plunged into the darkness, the ring of his smart
step dying away upon the bridge as he joined his
companions-in-arms, and went off to blow his trumpet till
silenced for ever upon one of the bloody battle-fields of
Spain.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
